"Dreams, visions, and prophecies i dont really care about. What I care about is that they get the themes of the story right. What is the story trying to say, what is the wisdom of GRRM, and what does he ultimately wish to say with the story of A Song of Ice and Fire.

&amp;#x200B;

We get many themes in the books, many are easy to pick out. Like the tragedy of Dany choosing the easy path of war, cause peace is too hard, requires too many sacrifices. Or that knights are only chivalrous in stories, and reality is dirty. Easy themes usually transferred into the show, though some are changed to be more positive like Dany choosing war.

&amp;#x200B;

But the main theme of the show, presumably the wisdom GRRM is passing down to us, deals with the Others, the Children, and the fate of humanity. Unfortunately, the show decided to remove this from the story cause themes are for eight graders, and instead just gave us an action sequence full of spectacle. Thats not why we enjoy the story. We enjoy the story cause of what GRRM is passing down onto us. How his life shaped him and what wisdom he gives upon us.

&amp;#x200B;

Tolkeins life shaped him to the man he was when he wrote Lord of the Rings, and the wisdom passed down to us was about the struggle of man vs rapid industrialization. Were here cause we want THAT, not just a cool action sequence.

but I digress

retail is absolutely physically exploitative. good friend of mine needed a full knee replacement as a teenager bc the stepladder broke underneath them while retrieving 50 pound bags of cat litter from the top shelf (those bags aren't stackable so management liked to have them up top). management didn't pay a cent cause they had provided a too-short stepladder, forcing them to use that top step that's ""not a step."" that way, when it DID break, they could say the worker knowingly did something unsafe &amp; is responsible. she continued to work there &amp; in fact works there to this day bc she got kicked out for being gay, so no choice. she interviewed other places but the management of her current job told them all she sued them for workman's comp so none of them would hire her. oh, and her pay got docked. she picked up another 2 very similar, very low-paying jobs to make up for it.

another friend from further back, somewhere around 12, was working under the table for an uncle who wanted her at the shop doors at 4am so she could get things ready for him to open before she went to school every day &amp; then close for him every night. she took drugs to counter the sleep deprivation &amp; walked to the store alone, in the dark. her parents were abusive &amp; made her pay rent, so she couldn't quit.

"And a shit ton of the haters, hatred the entire episode somehow and just started not picking every fucking thing. Meanwhile as a TV episode, it was a 9/10. 

But because they ended it the way they did, and the plot armor, for a GOT episode, 
5/10 range. Maybe worse. Maybe better. Idk. 

So it comes from both sides. Some people truly liked it and it doesn't bother tjem. That's not me. And I don't get that. But hey, good for you. Lol

Some liked most of it, but are slightly frustrated. Just doesn't ruin it as much for them. 

Some people are really frustrated because they feel 90% of it was dam good, and they set things up nicely in many areas just to bitch out. That's me.

I mean I enjoyed a ton of it. I'm still pissed af. 

And the some just say the whole thing fucking sucked. Every little part. Which is ridiculous. And they're usually the ones saying everything GOT sucks balls and absolutely nothing has been good since 4 and the books will fix everything.

It's not even close to that black and white. 
I think seasons 1-6 will hold up nicely. We don't need to be told that 1-4 are the best consistency wise, even if 2 was slightly weak imo, as we already know. That doesn't make 5-6 absolutely horseshit and the mean it ruined the show.

7 was rushed and absolute ass.  Only season that took me out of the show. 

I'll stop reserve judgements on 8 until it's completely finished as I think something big will tie things together. Probably shock alot of people and make the last episode more understandable. If not. It's with 7. In the trash.",1

Dowry in Chinese culture is not a law but tradition.  Husbands also often help out with wife's family.  You may not want to follow that, which is completely fine, but it sound like you don't actually know the Chinese family cultures and traditions. 

There is no fucking law against dowry in Canada. It is not illegal, just not recognized by law all the time in the specific cultural senses (which depends on the culture) but there has been court ruling to include a dowry.

In Chinese culture, dowry is made to the bride's family by the husband, not the other way round. And if a couple split, wife can still be rewarded a split of networth of the husband, or the other way round, for that matter.

I had property before I married but I recognize that once I get married, my husband can get a share of my networth/property. I love him and am happy to share ny life and everything in it with him.

"&gt; Right now you have a president that is doing everything he said he was going to do which was the reason people voted for him in the first place. 

Most of his supporters voted for him because:

1. His last name isn't Clinton
2. He's not a Democrat
3. He's not black

They would have voted for anyone who met those qualifications. The rest voted for him because they had something to gain from a Republican in the White House.

Whether he's doing what people voted for him to do is a matter of debate, but he's definitely hurting the working-class people who voted for him in order to help the wealthy. He's such a shitty leader that even with all 3 branches of government under GOP control, the only major legislative victory in 2 years was a tax scam passed under the guise of budget reconciliation. A tax scam that is fucking over the middle class working folks who voted for him. Now we're in a trade war that is fucking over the middle class working folks, including the agriculture industry.

On top of that, he's a narcissistic idiot with dementia who can't speak for more than 30 seconds without lying about something. He acts like a spoiled child when he doesn't get his way. If a Democrat behaved like this then everyone who leaned right would be losing their fucking minds, but they don't care because they feel like they're ""winning"" somehow.",1

"&gt;First, let's recall what that dialog looked like

Ok. The dialogue looked like this:

&gt;""There is no evidence of collusion.""

Simple stuff.

&gt;There was an awful lot of smoke being reported by reputable sources, and there's not a single piece that NYT or WaPo or WSJ reported on the Trump-Rusiia front that Mueller Report disproved.

[You're wrong.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/donald-trump-russia-collusion-cia.html)

[I can do this all day.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/17/yes-there-was-collusion-now-what-will-we-do-about-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d7340256626f)

[There are literally dozens of articles.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/not-true-james-comey-denounces-nyt-report-on-trump-campaign-collusion-with-russia-during-testimony)

(Made sure to use WaPo and NYT articles just for you - there are plenty more, too - just let me know if you need them.)

&gt;So all the stuff that happened that caused us to call for an investigation is shit that *really did happen*.

[You mean a false report that was debunked mid investigation?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

&gt;The softening of the RNC platform, the multiple attempts to establish communication backdoors, the contact between Sessions and Kislayak, and him suibsequently lying about it, a ton of other Trump staffers and Trump himself getting caught lying about contact with Russians - all that was real.

\[Sources please.\]

&gt;What's not real is the characterization that there was ""no collusion"" according to the Mueller report. The accurate characterization is that there wasn't enough admissible evidence to indict for it. Here's what the report has to say on the subject in its opening paragraphs:

That's some hard-core mental gymnastics for a huge nothing burger. Try harder. Your opinion is irrelevant. Meullers isn't. And Meuller said: ""No Evidence of Collusion.""

No matter what you may think constitute evidence... it's irrelevant. Meuller found none and your opinion on the matter is now irrelevant. Thanks for sharing it, though.

&gt;The report proceeds to name Flynn, Papadopolous, Cohen and Manafort as those who got charged.

Are you pretending that these people are guilty of collusion? Because literally none were charged with anything remotely resembling collusion.

&gt;That's not a determination that there was no collusion/coordination/conspiracy. That's ""we investigated the campaign and found enough dirt to indict the campaign manager and his right-hand guy along with Flynn and Papadop. Everyone else covered their tracks well enough that we can't bring a case against them.""

If you investigate a murder and find out that the suspect and his buddies are drug dealers... you arrest them for dealing drugs. But that doesn't mean they're murderers.

In this case: If you investigate collusion and find evidence of Tax Fraud (from years prior and not associated with a ""Russian Collusion"" investigation) you arrest them for their crimes - but that doesn't mean you get to label them as a traitor.

You're trying really hard to make 2+2=5.

&gt;Then of course it's followed by a second half of the report that says ""by the way, here's an open-and-shut case on the president obstructing the everloving shit out of our investigation. Did we mention that's a federal felony? Hey Congress, time for you guys to do your job.""

You must have a gold medal for the Mental Gymnastic Olympics.  Do you know how quotes work? Because that was literally never said. You're paraphrasing with a ridiculous bias. You're painting "" ***The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him***,' as ""he is clearly guilty.""

That is blatantly false. It's about as neutral a statement as one can get (and mine is the actual quote).

Look - it's clear you're chomping at the bit to get Trump with something... but why?

What is your obsession with finding him doing something wrong? What would have to happen for you to rethink your position? What event would need to take place in order for you to take a critical look at the treatment of the President of the United States?",1

"I wasn’t saying that dragons in and of themselves existing is the unbelievable thing. Dragons should not exist because they’d collapse under their own weight. It has nothing to do with magic, that’s just science and logic. Same thing with a skeleton hand punching through solid rock. It’s all the same rules of reality that govern gravity, survivability in combat, and the relatively sharpness of weaponry. If those things are okay, then so should someone managing to disentangle themselves from a swarm with the use of their one-shot zombie lightsabers and the aid of close-by allies. Otherwise, you’re utilizing *selective suspension,* where something’s that break reality and logic and somethings aren’t just because you wanted to see some more dead main characters. 

That’s my thing. The more I hear people saying it’s a matter of believability and physics and whatever, the more it just doesn’t add up because if you actually cared about these characters and their struggles and stories and lives, then the fact they did survive despite these insurmountable odds should be joyous. Instead it seems like it matters more that fucking Isaac Newton’s math homework should be respected and just *bitch, bitch, bitch.* If you like these people and this story, then why it is such a big deal? Why the endless debates? Especially when there’s not been a precedent for major characters dying in battle, and statistically speaking, that’s when a main character is the safest. Name me a main character or major supporting character who has died in the thick of battle like everyone seemed to expect this episode. There was Ygritte. That’s the only one who comes to my mind.

I understand it’s an issue, maybe they should have shot those scenes to be less dogpile-y or Arya’s leap should be shorter or whatever else, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad writing or a bad story. It’s bad math and bad physics, but math and physics and even *logic herself* are not the rulers of Story-Town. They can advise on some things, but they do not make the final call. Even in Game of Thrones, they’ve never made the final call. And if that’s your primary concern when it comes to stories, then maybe you need to re-examine your priories.",1

Young naive millennials need to stop thinking socialism is en vogue. ""Democratic socialism"" and ""social democracy"" as practiced by the Nordic countries are NOT the same thing.

2. He's not a Democrat
3. He's not black

They would have voted for anyone who met those qualifications. The rest voted for him because they had something to gain from a Republican in the White House.

Whether he's doing what people voted for him to do is a matter of debate, but he's definitely hurting the working-class people who voted for him in order to help the wealthy. He's such a shitty leader that even with all 3 branches of government under GOP control, the only major legislative victory in 2 years was a tax scam passed under the guise of budget reconciliation. A tax scam that is fucking over the middle class working folks who voted for him. Now we're in a trade war that is fucking over the middle class working folks, including the agriculture industry.

On top of that, he's a narcissistic idiot with dementia who can't speak for more than 30 seconds without lying about something. He acts like a spoiled child when he doesn't get his way. If a Democrat behaved like this then everyone who leaned right would be losing their fucking minds, but they don't care because they feel like they're ""winning"" somehow.",1
"If you think modern Russia has anything to do with communism, you are even more deluded that most members of the Trump personality cult.

Are you serious? The fact that he's been great defensively despite our backline's woes shows how good he is. And the fact that you think he's sacrificed his attacking game shows you don't watch him. He's bombed forward a number of times to create goals and good chances. Just on Sunday he was the one who created Mata's goal. The problem is that he's not able to that super often because the rest of our backline frankly isn't good enough to cover for him, and our midfield will hardly do him any favors defensively.

"I’m almost certain the 12 year old girl wasn’t buying a dildo but rather a clitoral vibrator. Young girls typically use small clitoral vibrators and I’m certain that’s what this girl’s mom agreed to buy her... these vibrators also have no resemblance of a penis either... so is that okay then? 

Additional, it seems you’re under the assumption that all women/young girls can orgasm with just their hands, which is absolutely untrue. Nearly 50% of women need a vibrator to orgasm during masturbation and 5% of women will never orgasm once in their lifetime. So you’re theory that a girl using a vibrator means she’s advancing to something more serious than strictly manual masturbation is flawed, because for a lot of women, including myself, the first time they ever masturbating is with a clitoral vibrator due to their inability to orgasm or even come close to orgasm without it. 

Your last comment is confusing... are you saying it’s okay for a 12 year old to have a vibrator or pocket pussy as long as they sneak around their parents back? It seems you’re making the argument that the reason it was wrong for you to have one at 12 was because it would have made your dad uncomfortable, not because there’s anything wrong with having one?",1

If you spend any time intercting with antivaxers on social media, you will see a very common link: they espouse bodily purity, ""clean"" eating and anything ""natural"": organic food, essential oils, chiropractic and homeopathy, that sort of thing.  All of that is out of reach for many low income households, as is traveling overseas (linked to the current NY outbreak) and going to theme parks (2015 Disneyland outbreak).

In the end, it is extremely privileged and selfish to refuse to take on the responsibility (and minimal risk) of vaccinating one's children while relying on herd immunity to do the job.

Liberals being angry and calling out the Republicans for being the hypocritical pieces of shit they are is entirely reactionary to what the conservatives have become in this country.

"And a shit ton of the haters, hatred the entire episode somehow and just started not picking every fucking thing. Meanwhile as a TV episode, it was a 9/10. 

But because they ended it the way they did, and the plot armor, for a GOT episode, 
5/10 range. Maybe worse. Maybe better. Idk. 

So it comes from both sides. Some people truly liked it and it doesn't bother tjem. That's not me. And I don't get that. But hey, good for you. Lol

Some liked most of it, but are slightly frustrated. Just doesn't ruin it as much for them. 

Some people are really frustrated because they feel 90% of it was dam good, and they set things up nicely in many areas just to bitch out. That's me.

I mean I enjoyed a ton of it. I'm still pissed af. 

And the some just say the whole thing fucking sucked. Every little part. Which is ridiculous. And they're usually the ones saying everything GOT sucks balls and absolutely nothing has been good since 4 and the books will fix everything.

It's not even close to that black and white. 
I think seasons 1-6 will hold up nicely. We don't need to be told that 1-4 are the best consistency wise, even if 2 was slightly weak imo, as we already know. That doesn't make 5-6 absolutely horseshit and the mean it ruined the show.

7 was rushed and absolute ass.  Only season that took me out of the show. 

I'll stop reserve judgements on 8 until it's completely finished as I think something big will tie things together. Probably shock alot of people and make the last episode more understandable. If not. It's with 7. In the trash.",1

* China can't say shit, same reason as Russia.

"I’m almost certain the 12 year old girl wasn’t buying a dildo but rather a clitoral vibrator. Young girls typically use small clitoral vibrators and I’m certain that’s what this girl’s mom agreed to buy her... these vibrators also have no resemblance of a penis either... so is that okay then? 

Additional, it seems you’re under the assumption that all women/young girls can orgasm with just their hands, which is absolutely untrue. Nearly 50% of women need a vibrator to orgasm during masturbation and 5% of women will never orgasm once in their lifetime. So you’re theory that a girl using a vibrator means she’s advancing to something more serious than strictly manual masturbation is flawed, because for a lot of women, including myself, the first time they ever masturbating is with a clitoral vibrator due to their inability to orgasm or even come close to orgasm without it. 

Your last comment is confusing... are you saying it’s okay for a 12 year old to have a vibrator or pocket pussy as long as they sneak around their parents back? It seems you’re making the argument that the reason it was wrong for you to have one at 12 was because it would have made your dad uncomfortable, not because there’s anything wrong with having one?",1
"I’d like to point out something that everyone seems to be skipping. Your daughter’s biological mother is the one who skipped out on Mother’s Day with her child. It’s funny how no one is calling her a cunt or an asshole or saying she’s horrible for not spending Mother’s Day with the child she actually birthed and raised. You don’t even seem upset about that.....but you are angry with your wife, who has only been a step-parent for 3.5 years and only sees your daughters 4 days a month. 

Have you considered that given the length of your marriage and the age of your kids, your daughters likely have never really seen your wife in a motherly role and vice versa? That’s pretty normal. I see it all the time in posts written by step-kids. “I have a mom/dad. I don’t need another one.” “My stepmom is always trying to act like she can tell me what to do.” “My stepdad needs to back off. I don’t need his advice.” Blending families when the kids are preteens and teens doesn’t work like it does when kids are young, especially if Mom or Dad are still fully involved. Parental relationships don’t develop as naturally, if at all. A “fun aunt” or friendly type relation tends to happen in healthy households instead. 

There’s just a lot of information missing from this post. What kind of relationship does your wife have with your daughters? Is she close with them? Has she made overtures? Have they indicated at any time they see her as a mother? Has there been serious tension or bad experiences? Has she been given a motherly role in your daughter’s life? Do you and your ex allow your wife to actually parent? Is she involved in decision making as equally? Would your daughter have wanted to spend Mother’s Day with your wife if her biological mother was available? Has your daughter ever even acknowledged your wife on Mothers day before? 

Depending on the answer to any of those questions, your wife could be being perfectly reasonable or a total asshole. Either way, it’s not particularly fair for you to expect her to “fill-in” because biomom is busy doing something else.",1

"I wasn’t saying that dragons in and of themselves existing is the unbelievable thing. Dragons should not exist because they’d collapse under their own weight. It has nothing to do with magic, that’s just science and logic. Same thing with a skeleton hand punching through solid rock. It’s all the same rules of reality that govern gravity, survivability in combat, and the relatively sharpness of weaponry. If those things are okay, then so should someone managing to disentangle themselves from a swarm with the use of their one-shot zombie lightsabers and the aid of close-by allies. Otherwise, you’re utilizing *selective suspension,* where something’s that break reality and logic and somethings aren’t just because you wanted to see some more dead main characters. 

That’s my thing. The more I hear people saying it’s a matter of believability and physics and whatever, the more it just doesn’t add up because if you actually cared about these characters and their struggles and stories and lives, then the fact they did survive despite these insurmountable odds should be joyous. Instead it seems like it matters more that fucking Isaac Newton’s math homework should be respected and just *bitch, bitch, bitch.* If you like these people and this story, then why it is such a big deal? Why the endless debates? Especially when there’s not been a precedent for major characters dying in battle, and statistically speaking, that’s when a main character is the safest. Name me a main character or major supporting character who has died in the thick of battle like everyone seemed to expect this episode. There was Ygritte. That’s the only one who comes to my mind.

I understand it’s an issue, maybe they should have shot those scenes to be less dogpile-y or Arya’s leap should be shorter or whatever else, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad writing or a bad story. It’s bad math and bad physics, but math and physics and even *logic herself* are not the rulers of Story-Town. They can advise on some things, but they do not make the final call. Even in Game of Thrones, they’ve never made the final call. And if that’s your primary concern when it comes to stories, then maybe you need to re-examine your priories.",1

"Maybe start with assuming that maybe the women you've run into in your day-to-day life might be smarter and more interesting than they seem at first.

It could be that you're relying a little too much on early impressions, and ruling out girls you might find more intriguing given a little more time.

That said, if you really think you're given women a fair shake and you just haven't been attracted to very many, don't worry about it too much.

I consider there to have been only about 4 men I've met that I've been genuinely attracted to enough to potentially pursue (2 unpursued crushes, 1 ex, 1 current SO). For reference I am late-twenties female.

I would not encourage you to lower your standards, only to possibly given women a little more time before making the judgment they don't meet them. But again, you might be doing that already and just haven't gotten lucky yet.",0

"First, this article is bunk because no matter whether a president can or can't be indicted, Mueller was never going to stray from DOJ policy.

Second, a sitting president can't be indicted. The executive branch is in charge of carrying out and enforcing the laws Congress creates. if a president committed a crime, ultimately it would fall to that very same president, as the highest level of authority of the executive branch, to decide whether or not to indict and prosecute that case. 

Seems like most presidents would just excuse their own crimes since they'd have that self autonomy.

Which is why they have the check of the House being able to impeach a charge and the Senate then convicting, with subsequent removal from office.

I'm pretty sure that our original government framers were capable of seeing the ridiculousness of what would be the president prosecuting himself essentially.

What they definitely didn't see becoming a reality is Congress becoming a corporately sponsored hyper partisan body that over the years regularly grinds to a halt on a regular basis due to disagreements across party lines.",1

"&gt;They drove around to McDonald's and harassed a worker who was African-America through the drive thru window.

That is a legal issue, not a school issue.  Denying someone access to public education for off campus crimes is not legal, and would be a dangerous precedent to set.  In fact, based on Chicago crime stats it would disproportionately effect students of color.

&gt;It's not a huge leap to think it's entirely possible

Yes it is.  We can't punish people for what might happen.  If that is the case, we can go from there.  Staging an entire protest on assumption is just absurd.  

&gt;One student was expelled a few years ago over this, and his family sued the city in court over ""first amendment rights"" and the court agreed with the school.  

Every case like this that I have come across was a direct threat.  If you can show me something different, I would reevaluate my stance.  The student I have heard speak on this claim ""if this had been a black student it would have been handled differently"".  I am fairly certain that there are plenty of students, from every ethnic background and race, with criminal records, who have received no punishment for off school crimes, no matter how heinous.  That's because it is how they system workes.  Schools are not courts 

&gt;School should be preparing students for life in the real world, and in the real world there are consequences for things you do and say.

Socially, yes.  Legally no.  They should also be showing students that there are direct concequences to drug use, violent crime, theft, etc.  To suggest that this is the role of schools and not courts is flat out BAD.  In no way should we deny people education for out of school crime.  Again, this would disproportionately effect youth of color.  We should not dictate laws through the educational system.  We also shouldn't decide which laws are okay to break by students based on your personal barometer or what's not okay today.  

&gt;This is real world action here.

You clearly don't understand the difference between the government and private industry, your friend, Facebook, Twitter can do what they want as far as banning unpopular speech.  I never suggested otherwise.  The government cannot, in any way shape or form, no matter how offended you are.

At no point did I suggest there should be no social ramifications for thier actions.  They will and should be outcast from social groups, removed from team sports.  These images should be pulled from social media.  What shouldn't be done is the government putting any barrier between children and education.  I feel like physical assault is a far greater crime than blackface;  how many people would be prevented from accessing education if we expelled everyone who commited assault off campus?   As stated before, this would be an expellable offense at a private school, public schools have a duty to make sure all students have access to education.  That doesn't only apply to students who aren't assholes.  Criminals are dealt with by the legal system not the school system.  Protesting the schools to punish them is as effective as protesting the courts to lock someone up for using racial slurs.  It would be completely unenforceable and defended to the end by the ACLU.  Any concession of free speech to a government entity is dangerous because in 20 years, your ideas might be unpopular.",0

"I felt bad for you at first but then you literally shred her culture into pieces. 

Dowry in Chinese culture is not a law but tradition.  Husbands also often help out with wife's family.  You may not want to follow that, which is completely fine, but it sound like you don't actually know the Chinese family cultures and traditions. 

There is no fucking law against dowry in Canada. It is not illegal, just not recognized by law all the time in the specific cultural senses (which depends on the culture) but there has been court ruling to include a dowry.

In Chinese culture, dowry is made to the bride's family by the husband, not the other way round. And if a couple split, wife can still be rewarded a split of networth of the husband, or the other way round, for that matter.

I had property before I married but I recognize that once I get married, my husband can get a share of my networth/property. I love him and am happy to share ny life and everything in it with him. There is nothing wrong with having a pre-nup, but I wonder what tone of voice you used when discussing the topic.

"Disappointing that it was all in one episode, and that for some reason, the Cersei/Jon/Dany storyline gets to be the end of the show instead of the ACTUAL POTENTIAL EXTINCTION OF ALL OF WESTEROS.

If we were in endless night horror shit where armies were starving and the white walkers were going slower, throwing dead waves of enemies at different main territories, some beig defended, some being killed and taken and ravaged, and some being held there left to starve while sleepless dead armies waited at the gates..

All of this happening while Cersei is watching the world burn and still battling through a war of attrition. Assuming her enemies will have to give up and surrender to her so she, while on the throne, could help with the defeat of the dead.

Maybe Cersei underestimates the Night King (Which apparently she didn't) and she is wiped out before the north/Dany's army is, and the final battle is what is shown in this episode. The night king eventually defeated in the Gods Wood.

This would probably take more episodes than we were given this season (RIP long seasons, Ghost, Dragons, Elephants) but a lot of it could be more just info given to our perspective characters such as Tyrion giving news that, for example, the twins were overrun by the dead and that its a loss of a strategic point against Cersei but also is more dead closing in on Winterfel/All of Westeros.

This was my hope before the season started but I knew my expectations were very high for a show making their own ending after following books to get them there before.",0

"I do not see this as valid criticism. I actually see this as criticism for the sake of criticism. Just because none of the 10 fan theories you read came to be true, doesn’t mean you start finding flaws where there aren’t any lol.

Why did the main characters survive? Think about it strong and hard, what possible explanation could there be for Brienne, Jon, Danny, tormund, jamie to survive? Well it’s because all of these guys are exceptional warriors and have been portrayed as such throughout the show (exception Danny but she has dragons lol). Throughout the show, each and every one of these individuals has been shown to be more courageous, more determined, more skilled than the others at combat. If any one survived, it should be these people.

Jorah mormont survives the first charge because he is a more accomplished warrior compared to the dothrakis - there is nothing that should be surprising here. Greyworm survived because he is the leader of the unsullied and why is that? Because he is the best of the unsullied.

Jon and Danny survived because they had dragons and weren’t part of the battle for the most part.

Bran survived because he had a full blown mini army protecting him, plus a certain Arya who is perhaps one of the most accomplished assassins ever to set foot in Westeros.

Why did Tyrion and Sansa survive, because they were the smartest of the people in the crypt and took shelter and hid when others did not think to do so.

I mean if you’re going to talk about plot armor, how the fuck did the night king not die of dragon fire when Danny smoked his ass? I see no one complaining about that.

Yes, the battle of winterfell wasn’t perfect but, for anything that hyped, how can it even be perfect? Out of tens of millions watching the show, there were always going to be subsets who were going to have issues with the story and the plot.

All the people complaining right now, it just makes no sense to me because if you want to talk about plot armor, each and every character has been in extremely dangerous situations before and guess what, they all made it to the last season.  I guess what you folks really wanted is for everyone to die in season 3 lol.",1

3. He's not black

"I want to preface this by saying that the post you’re referring to wasn’t talking about “sex toys” as a whole, the child wasn’t buying a sex swing or a cock ring to use on a partner or a double headed dildo, she almost certainly buying a clitoral vibrator (these are very small are are meant to be used on your clitoris, not the same thing as a dildo) to use on herself, by herself. 

I’m curious what you think about nearly 50% of women needing to use a vibrator to masturbate otherwise it’s either extremely hard or they physically can’t orgasm... should those girls be deprived of being able to masturbate like everyone else because you’re uncomfortable with a 12 year old girl using a vibrator to masturbate?

5% of women can’t orgasm all together, never have, and never will, that’s 1 in 20 women and that fucking sucks, why should we deprive a much bigger population of  young women from being able to masturbate to orgasm the way the vast majority of boys are doing at that age just their bodies don’t respond the same to manual stimulation as boys 

What age do you think is appropriate for young women who can’t orgasm without a vibrator to be able to masturbate to completion? Because as a sex Ed teacher where my average student was 14 years old, a huge percentage of them were already having sex and some pregnant or already had a kid by the time I had them in my class... so is 12 really too young to have an orgasm? 

Additionally, why is there an age restriction on when girls are allowed to masturbate to completion? What’s wrong with them doing it at 12? Is there something harmful I’m unaware of about young kids masturbating? The average age of boys starting to masturbate is between 10-13 so what’s wrong with 12 for a girl? 

It kinda sounds like you’re just unaware of what “sex toy” and 12 year old would be buying with the guidance of her mother and why... you seem to think all “sex toys” are meant for partnered sex and therefore are encouraging sex rather than assisting in masturbation? Or maybe you just think masturbation is sinful? I can’t figure out why a 12 year old using a vibrator, bought with permission from her mom, to masturbate alone in her room is “wrong”?",0
"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically.

Have you tried being 100% honest with them about why you aren't going out with them?

In every single country where abortion was, at one point, legal and then, later, was made illegal, the number of fetuses aborted AND the number of women who died due to abortion OR pregnancy related complications increased...dramatically.

Legal abortions has been proven more than once to LOWER the amount of abortions AND deaths due to abortion AND pregnancy complications!

"It also filters some of the THC, meaning you have to smoke more to get the same amount of THC in your system.  

EDIT: Sorry, I should have cited my source.  

&gt; waterpipes filter out proportionately more psychoactive THC than they do other tars, thereby requiring users to smoke more to reach their desired high.   

https://www.canorml.org/healthfacts/smokestudy.html  

&gt; waterpipes performed uniformly worse than the unfiltered joint. The least bad waterpipe, the bong, produced 30% more tar per cannabinoids than the unfiltered joint. Ironically, the pipe with the electric mixer scored by far the worst of any device. This suggests that water filtration is actually counterproductive, apparently because water tends to absorb THC more readily than noxious tars.

"To your point, it’s interesting to note that the “original” first-person shooter video games (Wolfenstein 3D and Doom) were released in 1992 and 1993 respectively. These titles were revolutionary and made the entire “shooter” genre very popular. By the late 90s (when Columbine occurred), the games had become much more common, realistic and violent. To this day, First-person shooter games such as Call of Duty or Halo are among the most popular video games in America. 

Is it purely coincidental that young males started shooting their classmates shorty after we literally turned shooting people into a game? Many of the shooters have been reported to be avid fans of games of that genre. 

To expand upon this idea, I think it’s important to see that our problem with shootings in America is far to broad and complex to blame on any one issue. It is a combination of a fascination with murderers; a 24 hour news cycle that is desperate for ratings; a society that has become desensitized to violence through violent movies/shows/games; a worship of the military creating “wannabe soldiers”; a poor public education system; a poor mental health system;  and, yes, the wide availability of firearms. 

Many other factors work in as well, those are just some of the larger ones. Point is, there is no single issue to blame. Frequent shootings, be it gang violence, active shooters, accidents or suicides are a uniquely American problem due to a culmination of other unique American problems.",1

"In all honesty it sounds like he doesn't respect you, if I were you I would RUN. If he isn't willing to take your feelings into consideration then does he even love you? I feel like it would be best to get out before you get hurt again, it seems likely that this behavior would happen again.

Imagine. 

You and your husband make up, things seem to be going well for you. You have date nights more often, he's started being more playful towards you, you feel like the two of you have gotten closer and overall the relationship seems to be going well. Then the inevitable happens. You notice his eyes lingering a little longer on other girls than they should, but you try to brush it off and think nothing of it, you tell yourself, ""we've been together and invested in this relationship so long, there's no way he would cheat on me, things are going well for us. Maybe I'm just paranoid."" Slowly it becomes more and more painstakingly obvious, he's clearly looking for other women because he isn't satisfied with what he already has, completely demeaning all of the work and loyalty you have put into this relationship. It slowly tears you up inside, you start wondering what you've been doing wrong, and if there's anything you can do to stop this hurtful behavior. Then it happens, you find him in bed with another woman. It crushes you, the painful questions start rolling in and completely envelope your mind, how could he do this to you? Why weren't you good enough? Why was he so selfish? Does he even care about you? Etc.",0

but I digress

retail is absolutely physically exploitative. good friend of mine needed a full knee replacement as a teenager bc the stepladder broke underneath them while retrieving 50 pound bags of cat litter from the top shelf (those bags aren't stackable so management liked to have them up top). management didn't pay a cent cause they had provided a too-short stepladder, forcing them to use that top step that's ""not a step."" that way, when it DID break, they could say the worker knowingly did something unsafe &amp; is responsible. she continued to work there &amp; in fact works there to this day bc she got kicked out for being gay, so no choice. she interviewed other places but the management of her current job told them all she sued them for workman's comp so none of them would hire her. oh, and her pay got docked. she picked up another 2 very similar, very low-paying jobs to make up for it.

another friend from further back, somewhere around 12, was working under the table for an uncle who wanted her at the shop doors at 4am so she could get things ready for him to open before she went to school every day &amp; then close for him every night. she took drugs to counter the sleep deprivation &amp; walked to the store alone, in the dark. her parents were abusive &amp; made her pay rent, so she couldn't quit.

What’s the actual benefit in her knowing the details of this? “Your dad is a shithead who cheated, btw bye see you never!” Great, so the child loses a person who was in her life, and now potentially thinks terribly of and doesn’t trust her actual parent. That’s just perfect! Where do things go from here? Surely up, for those rosy teenage years when nothing ever goes wrong!

OP basically got to drop a bomb and walk out in the aftermath. I am in no way justifying what happened to her. It completely sucks that this person she loved cheated on her, and what the dad did is complete shit. However, it’s not like OP is going to be around to do anything for this kid in the future. So setting fire to the dad‘s relationship with the daughter, doesn’t really accomplish anything except hurting the child.

"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically. 

Peoples misconception of the arcs and mixing that with theories they’ve heard and prophecies they’ve taken either literally or misinterpreted is the problem here more than bad writing",1

"""I love it,"" he says. ""I love the hitting. I love making the big play. I love being out there with my teammates. I love the camaraderie. I can't say I always love practice. But it's a means to an end. I want to have those big performances, those games you talk about years down the line. I want to win those big playoff games. I want to win a Super Bowl. I want to hold up the trophy. I want to splash Champagne on my teammates. I want to take care of my family for generations. I want to have my head turned into a bust in the Hall of Fame.

""Those things can only happen if I'm doing the best I can each and every day, looking out for my teammates and keeping out of trouble.""

Former Browns defensive line coach Clyde Simmons says Garrett ""has a chance to be one of the greats, as long as he stays healthy and continues to work on his craft."" In January, Simmons, who played defensive end in an era when nasty was a prerequisite for his position, also said he thinks there are ""some little things in there that I think he could be a little bit more aggressive about, a little nastier about.""

To which Garrett says: ""I'm the kind of guy who is always respectful of the game. I want to beat you, but I don't want to do anything dirty. I want to do it the clean way. You don't want to do something that hurts the team.""

During practices one fall at Texas A&amp;M, 6'5"", 325-pound offensive tackle Germain Ifedi grew frustrated after repeatedly being shown up by Garrett. On one play, Garrett long-armed the blocker, and his arm slid up to his throat. Ifedi, who now is with the Seahawks, threw a punch. Garrett avoided it. Then Ifedi charged Garrett.

Instead of fighting back, Garrett extended his arm, grabbed Ifedi's facemask and held him at bay. Ifedi kept swinging but couldn't connect.

That's Garrett—thoughtful and forceful at once.

Garrett realizes the mind is a powerful thing, even in a physical confrontation. Thomas helped him understand how to be a thinking man's defensive end by studying the offensive tackle Garrett would oppose each week during his rookie year. Thomas would  then give him three moves he thought could exploit his weaknesses.

""The nicest thing I can say about him is he's got the brain of an offensive lineman,"" Thomas says. ""He's not like your typical dumb defensive lineman. He's cerebral and thoughtful, and that really helps with the way he attacks offensive linemen.""

The forces within Garrett are not oppositional. They are complementary, yin and yang.

This is how he sees it: ""I'm caring and loving and supportive of people who have been forces in my life and have guided me where I am today. But football is my job. If I lose my job, I can't be supportive of the people who have been there for me. The person in front of me is trying to take my job. I have to whup him, or he beats me and takes my job. I'm not going to let that happen. I'm not out there to injure anybody, but I'm out there to hurt your will and make sure you don't want to do it anymore, take away your will to keep on fighting.""

Of course, like any good poet, he has a vision.

He can become one of the legends of the game, like Lawrence Taylor. ""I want to have the same impact on the game as LT,"" he says. ""That's big talk because he's one of the best ever. But it's doable.

""I want to go down as the greatest player to ever play.""",1

"What?

Rome controlled Jerusalem, and Rome became Christian. Emperor Constantine, the guy who made Rome Christian took complete power in 324AD. It was at this time that the First Council of Nicaea took place, and Christians began to immigrate to Jerusalem. That would put Byzantine Christians in control of Jerusalem 1,713 years ago. 

Then it was conquered by the Caliph Umar the Great in 636 AD.

Then it was reconquered by Christian nations in 1099. 

&gt;Or even, like.... 100 years ago?

Christians are STILL living in Jerusalem and they have been for a very long time.

EDIT: 

Actually, Christianity was in Jerusalem before 324. The Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre was founded after Constantine's Edict of Milan (313AD) which legalized Christianity throughout the Roman empire.

EDIT2: Okay okay, Christianity was actually in Jerusalem since the arrival of Jesus Christ, and the creation of the Christian Church basically between 4BC and 33AD. No more edits.",0

"Exactly. I'm just going to repost this here. I wrote it on a different thread and it's more relevant here:



As an outsider it's insane to watch you Americans talk about everything else but the guns. Yes mental health is an issue, an even bigger issue is the rampant bullying and mean evil culture young people deem acceptable so long as violence isn't used.


You guys need a complete ban on semi Auto weapon and a huge change more like Australia or England to all firearms. 

Yes if someone wants to kill they use other methods but ease of availability and ease of use put guns at number one. I would bet my life the amount of mass murders that have happened in the last decade would be a drastically lower number if ten years ago these changes were strictly implemented. There is no denying this. Yes the black market exists but your average bullied loner, scorned lover or extreme ideolog doesn't hang with criminals and can't usually get an assault rifle from them.


You guys need to wake up and realise that second amendment was written during a completely different era of humanity to cover a completely different challenge and everyone just loves their guns so much they hide behind it. The rest of the world watches on with disgust.",1

"OK, so this 12-year-old now knows that her dad cheated and is a shitty person. Now what? She’s going to be living with him for the next six years at least, she’s going to be emotionally invested in him likely for the rest of his life, while OP is basically going to be out of her life after this. 

What’s the actual benefit in her knowing the details of this? “Your dad is a shithead who cheated, btw bye see you never!” Great, so the child loses a person who was in her life, and now potentially thinks terribly of and doesn’t trust her actual parent. That’s just perfect! Where do things go from here? Surely up, for those rosy teenage years when nothing ever goes wrong!

OP basically got to drop a bomb and walk out in the aftermath. I am in no way justifying what happened to her. It completely sucks that this person she loved cheated on her, and what the dad did is complete shit. However, it’s not like OP is going to be around to do anything for this kid in the future. So setting fire to the dad‘s relationship with the daughter, doesn’t really accomplish anything except hurting the child.

"This is purely hypothetical empty pro-sex work bag being lofted up by an anti-sex work sophist who wants some answers in what next.

No one here is going to say prostitution under a capitalist system is moral just like no one is arguing child labor under a capitalist system is moral (ethical utilitarian whatever) but if we can conceive the unicorn exists (I know people who like to do sex work and are self employed and choose their dates/films so yes exchanging your wellbeing for value in a capitalist system is immoral but the idea that some sex workers don’t enjoy their jobs is kind if puritan) then where does that unicorn fit into socialist society? Or are we saying she can’t possibly enjoy her work (we all know women hate sex). 

So yes it is exploitative to sell your body in a capitalist society no one has made the argument otherwise. The real question is what are you defining as sex therapy? How do you feel about brothel credits for the mentally deficient? Is that sex therapy or prostitution?

Who says they were trying to? Their point is that anyone who still claims that everyone having guns would result in fewer gun deaths instead of more is too far gone.

American media has convinced people that guns make them safe, as though they're going to quickdraw and ""take down"" the shooter with their superior skills before they can do damage.

As for Arya sneaking up, she is kinda a well-established super assassin and we see that the undead aren't perfect detectors of humans by any means. And even then she is stopped by him and only succeeds because of fancy knife work.

The point of the storyline was to establish good from bad, give cersei a chance at redemption to make her a truly evil character, knock Khaleesi down a notch so she didn't have unstoppable forces,  and bring all our favorite characters back together to stand against the night.

It was far from perfect but it served those purposes and sets us up for getting back to the actual game of thrones. I just wish so many main characters hadn't been shown on the brink of death a dozen times then saved by plot armor. Really felt very un-GRRM-like.",1

"It's always been ""just another TV show"" it's just that GRRM is a master at misdirection. He makes you think Ned is the guy that's gonna solve it all and get to the root of the problem with the corrupt throne. Then it's Robb and Cat, with some aid from Renly. Then it's Stannis. But all of these were masterfully crafted red herrings. None of those characters were ever the ""main characters"" you just *thought* they were. The protagonists have always been Jon, Arya, Sansa, Theon to an extent, Dany, Bran (but I've got theories that he's not just a wholesome greenseer) If you look back at all of she sticky situations the actual main characters were in over the years, you can see that they were *never in real danger*. Why would Arya die a blind panhandler in bravos? Why would Sansa get tortured to death by ramsay Bolton? Ask yourself, ""for what purpose would this character die?"" and in every situation our main heroes were in over the years, them dying at that time made zero fucking sense. *There has always been plot armor*. Fucking Valyrian steel, dragonglass studded plate armor on every God damn one of our protagonists.

Now, I understand the gripes people have with the unrealistic situations Sam was in in ep3, Grey worm to a certain extent, yeah I guess Lyannas death was a bit cheesy on my 3rd re-watch but when it was live, I fucking loved it. I get that having *only* redshirt die in the crypts was a bit unbelievable. I wouldn't of minded maybe 2 more minor characters die who's arcs were complete like Grey worm and missandei. But for the rest of the cast? It just doesn't make sense for them to die in a hopeless slaughter. There's 4 hours of show left. Plenty of loose ends to tie up and more than enough time to do so.",1

"I wasn’t saying that dragons in and of themselves existing is the unbelievable thing. Dragons should not exist because they’d collapse under their own weight. It has nothing to do with magic, that’s just science and logic. Same thing with a skeleton hand punching through solid rock. It’s all the same rules of reality that govern gravity, survivability in combat, and the relatively sharpness of weaponry. If those things are okay, then so should someone managing to disentangle themselves from a swarm with the use of their one-shot zombie lightsabers and the aid of close-by allies. Otherwise, you’re utilizing *selective suspension,* where something’s that break reality and logic and somethings aren’t just because you wanted to see some more dead main characters. 

That’s my thing. The more I hear people saying it’s a matter of believability and physics and whatever, the more it just doesn’t add up because if you actually cared about these characters and their struggles and stories and lives, then the fact they did survive despite these insurmountable odds should be joyous. Instead it seems like it matters more that fucking Isaac Newton’s math homework should be respected and just *bitch, bitch, bitch.* If you like these people and this story, then why it is such a big deal? Why the endless debates? Especially when there’s not been a precedent for major characters dying in battle, and statistically speaking, that’s when a main character is the safest. Name me a main character or major supporting character who has died in the thick of battle like everyone seemed to expect this episode. There was Ygritte. That’s the only one who comes to my mind.

I understand it’s an issue, maybe they should have shot those scenes to be less dogpile-y or Arya’s leap should be shorter or whatever else, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad writing or a bad story. It’s bad math and bad physics, but math and physics and even *logic herself* are not the rulers of Story-Town. They can advise on some things, but they do not make the final call. Even in Game of Thrones, they’ve never made the final call. And if that’s your primary concern when it comes to stories, then maybe you need to re-examine your priories.",1

"I think there's a delicate balance that needs to be maintained between logical character choices and what makes good TV. I think if Arya just silently snuck up behind him and stabbed him in the back, that likely would have also been perceived as anticlimactic. The jump out of the darkness really gives the moment excitement and is amazing to watch in slow motion. Plus, I'm convinced Arya needed to stab the NK in the heart through the front of his chest in the same manner he was created in order for him to die, so the writers essentially needed her to do something that would make him turn around, hence the yell. I think you could probably argue that a guttural yell of rage may have actually been quite natural / involuntary in that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The same could be said for the complaints regarding the strategies used during the battle. Yes, in real life, maybe the wights and WWs could have easily just surrounded Winterfell and starved everyone out. Maybe they could have sent another WW henchman to fetch Bran and bring him to the NK. Maybe Dany could have slowly and methodically burned up bunches of wights while Jon guarded Bran. But all of this would have been pretty boring to watch.",1

"he didn't choose her, he choose the drugs and she was a necessary part of it that he found acceptable in order to get what he wanted. his actions with her probably weren't purposeful decisions, she likely just started and he didn't stop her because to stop her brings the risk of stopping his access to the drugs. chemical dependence is a hell of a thing and twists your logic and reason until everything circles back to the drugs.

see this man as he is, look without the goggles of your past experiences. i imagine he looks quite defeated. broken and in pain. look at how his fear and dependence has not only crippled him but drove him deeper into his own isolation, changed him into some grotesque caricature. now see that his suffering is entirely of his own making, how each choice he made has lead him down this path. he must slay his demons with his own hand or they will never stay dead.

once you see that, look at yourself, see how your own isolation and fear has begun to cripple *you*. recognize that this happened to you, meaning it was an external event separate from your own actions, but that your own withdrawal of your social life is leading you down a similar path of desperation. im not saying you are going to start fucking drug dealers to quiet your suffering, the variables are different but the emotional decisions you are making and their impacts are the same. 

are you broken, are you pathetic. your exBF is in a pathetic state, do you think you are there as well. do you want to get to that point.

"Great post. I'm also having a hard time accepting this is the end of Bran's story arc. I just wanted to point out this Melisandre chapter from ADWD where she sees Bran and the 3EC in one of her fire visions. She describes them as servants and champions of the Great Other.

&gt;Devan fed fresh logs to the fire until the flames leapt up again, fierce  and furious, driving the shadows back into the corners of the room,  devouring all her unwanted dreams. The dark recedes again… for a little  while. But beyond the Wall, the enemy grows stronger, and should he win the dawn will never come again. She wondered if it had been his face  that she had seen, staring out at her from the flames. No. Surely not.  His visage would be more frightening than that, cold and black and too  terrible for any man to gaze upon and live. The wooden man she had  glimpsed, though, and the boy with the wolf’s face… they were his  servants, surely… his champions, as Stannis was hers.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Melisandre I ADWD

I always thought this excerpt was meant to show Melisandre's hubris in her religion; however, based on the sudden end of the NK story arc in the show, perhaps it's further foreshadowing Bran's real motives. 

Also, GRRM has stated, albeit a really long time ago, that the Isle of Faces will come into play towards the end of the story.

&gt;The green men and the Isle of Faces will come to the fore in later books. -[https://winteriscoming.net/2016/11/25/memory-lane-martin-interview-after-a-clash-of-kings-release-still-offers-gems/](https://winteriscoming.net/2016/11/25/memory-lane-martin-interview-after-a-clash-of-kings-release-still-offers-gems/)

Dowry in Chinese culture is not a law but tradition.  Husbands also often help out with wife's family.  You may not want to follow that, which is completely fine, but it sound like you don't actually know the Chinese family cultures and traditions. 

There is no fucking law against dowry in Canada. It is not illegal, just not recognized by law all the time in the specific cultural senses (which depends on the culture) but there has been court ruling to include a dowry.

In Chinese culture, dowry is made to the bride's family by the husband, not the other way round. And if a couple split, wife can still be rewarded a split of networth of the husband, or the other way round, for that matter.

I had property before I married but I recognize that once I get married, my husband can get a share of my networth/property. I love him and am happy to share ny life and everything in it with him.

"""I love it,"" he says. ""I love the hitting. I love making the big play. I love being out there with my teammates. I love the camaraderie. I can't say I always love practice. But it's a means to an end. I want to have those big performances, those games you talk about years down the line. I want to win those big playoff games. I want to win a Super Bowl. I want to hold up the trophy. I want to splash Champagne on my teammates. I want to take care of my family for generations. I want to have my head turned into a bust in the Hall of Fame.

""Those things can only happen if I'm doing the best I can each and every day, looking out for my teammates and keeping out of trouble.""

Former Browns defensive line coach Clyde Simmons says Garrett ""has a chance to be one of the greats, as long as he stays healthy and continues to work on his craft."" In January, Simmons, who played defensive end in an era when nasty was a prerequisite for his position, also said he thinks there are ""some little things in there that I think he could be a little bit more aggressive about, a little nastier about.""

To which Garrett says: ""I'm the kind of guy who is always respectful of the game. I want to beat you, but I don't want to do anything dirty. I want to do it the clean way. You don't want to do something that hurts the team.""

During practices one fall at Texas A&amp;M, 6'5"", 325-pound offensive tackle Germain Ifedi grew frustrated after repeatedly being shown up by Garrett. On one play, Garrett long-armed the blocker, and his arm slid up to his throat. Ifedi, who now is with the Seahawks, threw a punch. Garrett avoided it. Then Ifedi charged Garrett.

Instead of fighting back, Garrett extended his arm, grabbed Ifedi's facemask and held him at bay. Ifedi kept swinging but couldn't connect.

That's Garrett—thoughtful and forceful at once.

Garrett realizes the mind is a powerful thing, even in a physical confrontation. Thomas helped him understand how to be a thinking man's defensive end by studying the offensive tackle Garrett would oppose each week during his rookie year. Thomas would  then give him three moves he thought could exploit his weaknesses.

""The nicest thing I can say about him is he's got the brain of an offensive lineman,"" Thomas says. ""He's not like your typical dumb defensive lineman. He's cerebral and thoughtful, and that really helps with the way he attacks offensive linemen.""

The forces within Garrett are not oppositional. They are complementary, yin and yang.

This is how he sees it: ""I'm caring and loving and supportive of people who have been forces in my life and have guided me where I am today. But football is my job. If I lose my job, I can't be supportive of the people who have been there for me. The person in front of me is trying to take my job. I have to whup him, or he beats me and takes my job. I'm not going to let that happen. I'm not out there to injure anybody, but I'm out there to hurt your will and make sure you don't want to do it anymore, take away your will to keep on fighting.""

Of course, like any good poet, he has a vision.

He can become one of the legends of the game, like Lawrence Taylor. ""I want to have the same impact on the game as LT,"" he says. ""That's big talk because he's one of the best ever. But it's doable.

""I want to go down as the greatest player to ever play.""",1

"&gt;The responses are crazy. There is a reason why sex stores only sell to 18+

What is that reason? Some would argue that it is because the are people who believe that youth under 18 shouldn't know anything about sex or sexuality. They may also consider such places to be perverse.

&gt;...isn't being overly sexual a sign of being sexually abused? Like ya kids start exploring at that age but I feel sex toys pushes it a bit too far.

Not really. It needs to be considered within an environmental context. The child is likely learning about sex in school and is curious. This is a sensitive period, and not a good time to shame them (if there is one).

&gt;Also if a 6th grader told her teacher or someone she trusted that her parents were buying her sex toys, CPS would be getting involved.

There may be questions since it isn't the norm. A social worker would want to determine the circumstances of the matter, but there wouldn't be an apprehension for allowing a child to explore their sexual development in a healthy way.",1

"**Welcome  to part 3 of the coverage of the XFL. Before we start, I wanna state for the record I don’t necessarily agree with everything said here. As a mod for XFL subreddit, I want to see the league succeed. With that being said, let’s begin.**

**When we last left off, the XFL was still in development. Now, we’re in week 2. And already, we’re seeing signs of issues. First, here are a compilation of quotes from people in the wrestling business, some taken from the McMahon DVD and others being from miscellaneous. This is part 3 of a 5 part series I’m doing. Part 4 will cover Jesse Ventura’s friend (We’ll reveal who when we get there) and part 5 will cover the XFL’s close and also showcase the oral history SB Nation did on the XFL. Enjoy.**

Ivory: We were just pissed. We were pissed. I kept always saying ""I just wanna meet the guy who’s jersey and helmet came out of my paycheck"". You know, we try not to talk about money too much in our car rides but we decided, one car ride— I remember it was with Bob Holly and some other people— we decided that, across the board, all of our royalties had gone down by 10%. So, we were like ""Hmm…"" So, these damn guys better be doing it right because they’re running around on our cash. Our livelihoods.

Joey Styles: The first thing you saw when the first XFL game came on the air on a Saturday night on NBC was The Rock. It wasn’t about football at that point. The next thing I saw was Vince McMahon, himself, in an XFL jacket walking to midfield with his over-the-top Mr. McMahon voice saying

(Clip of Vince McMahon saying ""This is the XFL"" plays)

Joey Styles: And I think what happened was by not letting the XFL live on its own without any WWE personalities, all of the WWE hating media, right or wrong, jumped on the XFL. and if that didn’t do it, the cheerleaders surely did, because there was sure as hell a big difference between traditional football cheerleaders and the strippers that were cheerleading for the XFL grinding in those outfits.

Eric Bischoff: Had the XFL been a 3 year plan or a 5 year plan, I think it would probably be around today. It would’ve changed the sports industry as we know it.

Bob Costas: I think it should have been as obvious as steering clear of a dark alley in a dangerous neighborhood. Everything about it screamed to me schlock and crap. Everything that subsequently occurred validated that impression. In fairness, Dick Ebersol never asked me. None of the announcers who were associated with NBC were going to be used on this experiment, so there was never any danger of that.

Bruce Prichard: This is developed on the private jet on the way to the first game. On a Wednesday before the first game. We start talking about what we used to do as kids. We used to put a football in the middle of the street and line up at opposite ends and whoever got the football first started with it. It was street football, that’s how we played street football. ""I love it"", Vince said.

It wasn’t discussed with any football people, not discussed with any coaches or players or any input from the football experts — It’s Michael Hayes, Bruce Prichard, Brian Gerwitz, Stephanie McMahon, Vince McMahon, and Dick Ebersol. So we were like, ""What do we call that""? I think Michael Hayes came up with the name ""Scramble"".

**Also, before the XFL premiered, they shot a bunch of promos highlighting the cheerleaders. There was only one problem: they were all dancers. They touted the cheerleaders as having day jobs like one being a doctor and one being a teacher except they were all dancers. Here’s what Bruce Prichard said about that.**

Bruce Prichard: So, I end the meeting kind of abruptly and I grabbed this lady and I said ""What the fuck""? I can make shit work, but now I’ve got to go back and explain to Vince that I got a chick that likes to read math books, I got a chick that works at a lawyer office, a chick that used to work at a doctor’s office or a chick that wanted to be a lawyer and um…

Conrad: Two dozen dancers.

Bruce Prichard: They’re all dancers! And I said ""What the fuck?"" ""Well, tomorrow will be a better group"". ""I’ve got to shoot shit today!""

Conrad: Yeah

Bruce Prichard: So, essentially, I just made shit up.

(Conrad laughs hard)

Bruce Prichard: I took the bitch that worked at a lawyer’s office, I put her in a lawyer’s office, man. I had her be a lawyer.

Conrad: Coming in hot with that language.

Bruce Prichard: I had the one— oh, this is another good one. This was one, we’ve got a sport trainer or something like that. So, I go talk to her. She dateda trainer in high school. I said ""Well, great. You’re gonna be my athletic trainer"". I took the chick that liked to read math books— now, get this: she liked to read math books but she hated math and she couldn’t do any math problems. So, I had to have her go bring me one of those math books and we just did a complicated math problem on the wall. And here’s my favorite part of all. When we divvied up crews and everything, I said ""You know what? I’ll take these girls, Michael, you and Brian, you go take these girls, and you take your crew and I’ll do my crew"". Well, I made it so that my crew and all my girls, I could shoot everything right there at the stadium. I just did backstage stuff and I made a training room, I made a classroom, I just made shit up there. And Stephanie McMahon stayed with me and helped me produce and Michael and them were up until the wee hours of the morning having to shoot stuff on location in Las Vegas. It SUCKKKKKKED. Because they were just local dancers.",1

"Feminism *is* about hating men tho, the fact that they are factually correct is not really relevant.

The same is true here, men obviously are more aggressive and are more violent, but femanazis only use that truth in their efforts to spread hatred and fear.

They knew they were developing a much more complicated game and the niche would be smaller. Maybe part of them thought that all the old dota 1 players would flock to dota 2 but Im sure that thought was extinguished pretty quickly. 

Now dota makes a good amount of money on it's own, but its also just an excellent way to get people to download steam and buy games. Valve realizes this and that is why they put on the most prestegious esports event of the year- to get people to try dota, but more importantly install steam.",0

"Has society really become so debased in recent times that we signal our respect to others by typing ""F""? How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - ""Call of Duty"", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and ""pressing F"". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice.

"I wasn’t saying that dragons in and of themselves existing is the unbelievable thing. Dragons should not exist because they’d collapse under their own weight. It has nothing to do with magic, that’s just science and logic. Same thing with a skeleton hand punching through solid rock. It’s all the same rules of reality that govern gravity, survivability in combat, and the relatively sharpness of weaponry. If those things are okay, then so should someone managing to disentangle themselves from a swarm with the use of their one-shot zombie lightsabers and the aid of close-by allies. Otherwise, you’re utilizing *selective suspension,* where something’s that break reality and logic and somethings aren’t just because you wanted to see some more dead main characters. 

That’s my thing. The more I hear people saying it’s a matter of believability and physics and whatever, the more it just doesn’t add up because if you actually cared about these characters and their struggles and stories and lives, then the fact they did survive despite these insurmountable odds should be joyous. Instead it seems like it matters more that fucking Isaac Newton’s math homework should be respected and just *bitch, bitch, bitch.* If you like these people and this story, then why it is such a big deal? Why the endless debates? Especially when there’s not been a precedent for major characters dying in battle, and statistically speaking, that’s when a main character is the safest. Name me a main character or major supporting character who has died in the thick of battle like everyone seemed to expect this episode. There was Ygritte. That’s the only one who comes to my mind.

I understand it’s an issue, maybe they should have shot those scenes to be less dogpile-y or Arya’s leap should be shorter or whatever else, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad writing or a bad story. It’s bad math and bad physics, but math and physics and even *logic herself* are not the rulers of Story-Town. They can advise on some things, but they do not make the final call. Even in Game of Thrones, they’ve never made the final call. And if that’s your primary concern when it comes to stories, then maybe you need to re-examine your priories.",1

"&gt; There are a lot of misconceptions about these women that are holding them back. People think they've slept with 1000's of men, that they likely have diseases, that they are criminals, that they are probably drug addicts who have become somewhat violent and dangerous as a survival mechanism and have lost touch with the moral norms of society... These are all true,

I married a woman who lied about her history and what she had been up to for most of her life. Believe me, she hid it quite well. There were clues I missed because I lacked context and experience but just the same, from time to time in the year and a half I knew her before getting married she occasionally let slip comments that a more knowledgeable person would have or could have picked up on. Tracing back to through her history and occasional comments, hiring a PI to follow her around when I wasn't home and literally catching her in the act, I had to face the fact she had been a prostitute and still was an active prostitute. She secretly continued using drugs which I found out when I had to call an ambulance after an overdose and her son retrieved the barbiturate container which we showed EMS so they could treat her effectively, and then she blamed me for causing her to use drugs. She would become violent for no particular reason, she was a chronic and skilled liar, she defrauded the immigration system to get here and in the end was hit with an annulment based on fraud and deported with her son. She did lose touch with any form of ethics and social norms. It's not that she didn't know what right and wrong was, she just didn't care. To her, she didn't mind doing anything so long as she wasn't caught. When caught, she declared I was stupid with all my ethics, like, not lying and stealing from family, friends and your spouse. Oh, and not seeing the benefits of prostitution and getting into her ""business"". Even the judge slammed her on these issues. Oh, she talked so sweet and sounded so nice, like the sweet little victim as her attorney fell for her sweet talk and defended her enthusiastically. On the last day of hearings when we brought out all the documents that showed she was lying to everyone including the federal government her own attorney finally realized how badly he'd been misled. He actually believed her. I even felt a bit of pity for him when in utter disgust he threw his carefully thought out notes on the table in disgust. As for her, I felt no pity when I saw the look of shock on her face as the judge granted me annulment based on fraud and slammed his gavel down. Everything she had worked and schemed for destroyed in that moment. I didn't even feel bad when I learned she had been deported. She had her chance and blew it. You can take the whore off the streets but you can't make a whore into a wife or a respectable citizen. The only misconception  here is thinking there are misconceptions. No, society has this right.",1

"I’m almost certain the 12 year old girl wasn’t buying a dildo but rather a clitoral vibrator. Young girls typically use small clitoral vibrators and I’m certain that’s what this girl’s mom agreed to buy her... these vibrators also have no resemblance of a penis either... so is that okay then? 

Additional, it seems you’re under the assumption that all women/young girls can orgasm with just their hands, which is absolutely untrue. Nearly 50% of women need a vibrator to orgasm during masturbation and 5% of women will never orgasm once in their lifetime. So you’re theory that a girl using a vibrator means she’s advancing to something more serious than strictly manual masturbation is flawed, because for a lot of women, including myself, the first time they ever masturbating is with a clitoral vibrator due to their inability to orgasm or even come close to orgasm without it. 

Your last comment is confusing... are you saying it’s okay for a 12 year old to have a vibrator or pocket pussy as long as they sneak around their parents back? It seems you’re making the argument that the reason it was wrong for you to have one at 12 was because it would have made your dad uncomfortable, not because there’s anything wrong with having one?",1

Then you have people complaining about battle strategy when Battle of the Bastards has the same shitty battle planing with an unexpected ex machina and yet only this episode gets shit on while that BotB gets praised. This is Star Wars level of nitpicking(minus the racist/sexist comments to the actors on twitter). Half of reddit is complaining about dumb stuff like oh it’s too dark, oh this battle strategy in this fantasy show isn’t realistic, after years of subversion and having main characters die; they subvert is again by not having one main character die. As for the “someone dies if they make mistakes”, this isn’t true, many people have been ex machina’d many times in S1-4. Jon should have died in seasons 1-4, Dany should have died in the slave arena and Samwell sure as shit should have died in S1-4 so I don’t wanna hear mistakes would always lead to death when that’s not true",1

"Well, firstly, because like I literally just said its socioeconomic. Social *and* economic. There are societal biases that hinder many minorities, so it's a way to try to help that. Plus, simply having more diverse peoples in places of power and education helps change a culture and support growth as long as they still work hard. I'm down for giving an extra chance at the start to counterbalance statistical and societal disadvantages, but if ya slack off you should get dropped. To label it as a simply economic issue is underplaying the massive racial I equality issues across the board.

Secondly, most minority groups are disproportionately effected by poverty, so by targeting an outlier group in hopes to improve their position you're fighting a massive chunk of the poverty issue in general. It's of course an imperfect net, but I think it helps

We also have many grant systems to help those impoverished, but that still doesn't help a lot (but that spirals into a whole nother topic of free college etc etc that's way too complex in and of itself)

Of course, the root cause of the issue you talk about is poverty, and that's a whole complex discussion of itself as well. While hope we can help everyone, that'll take a lot more action and will never be perfect. Like any welfare or social system, there's gonna be false positives and false negatives.

"Yes, after 2 or 3 weeks where the only thing we had was the Barr summary which turned out to be criminally misleading at best.

It's called getting the narrative out there before the real report is released.

Mueller's team already had summaries of each section of the report that they intended to be released to the public as soon as they filed the report. Barr directly ignored this and substituted with his own ""summary"" that he later backtracked and said it wasn't supposed to be a summary after Mueller's team called him out on it.",1

Imagine if he starts Rose as a CM when Wanyama, Sissoko, Alli and Eriksen are all fit, coupled with Foyth at rb when Trippier and Rose are fit, and you get trounced (which this Ajax side are easily capable of doing). Poch would look like a fool. In a CL semi final. You just don’t do that at this stage. His hand was forced this match due to the injury to Kane and the suspension of Son.

Maduro is a shitty leader but as Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Iraq have proved of the last two decades a shitty leader is better than a failed state and a civil war.

We've had absolutely nothing on the scale of the sorts of attacks frequently happening in America. Its really not that complicated.

"Game of Thrones has always been about the epic power struggle between 3 generations of Starks, Lannisters, and Targaryens, with the Baratheons, Tyrells, Greyjoys, Boltons, Freys, etc. also caught in the midst of the struggle. The War of the 5 Kings, The Red Wedding, Theon Greyjoy's betrayal, all of that is critical to the main story, which is a character driven plot centered around the Iron Throne. 

The whole White Walker storyline is like this separate narrative that is loosely stitched together with the main story. It's like a spinoff series that's edited into the main show.

It's completely pointless to the central narrative. It's just like this unnecessary subplot on the side.",0

Liberals being angry and calling out the Republicans for being the hypocritical pieces of shit they are is entirely reactionary to what the conservatives have become in this country.

He's trying to move the credit to the guy who kept changes in place rather than the guy who actually made the changes.  That's his argument, and it's bullshit.  Don't let him move the goalposts on you and move the focus on to this extraneous stuff.",0

"&gt;are you interpreting what was said or just ignoring what was actually said? they represented themselves as agents of the russian government..

The third party who broached the email, represented them as being agents of a rich oligarch, who themselves had second hand received the information from someone unnamed with a job title that does not exist in Russia.

That's LITERALLY the contents of that email.  Any other reading of it includes ""interpreting"".  If Mueller had doubted the testimony of the person who contacted the Trump campaign, he did not indicate such in the report, and that individual did not plead out or receive charges for perjury.  Are you suggesting we read that his testimony was false?

Personally I think GRRM is using the whitewalkers as metaphors for disease / a plague. While he's used the children of the forest / Bran as metaphors for the natural world.

So in the next three episodes there's probably going to be some sort of unexpected foe in Bran. How that might materialize is anyone's guess.",0

I'll look into it. Haven't heard about that.,1
"&gt;First, let's recall what that dialog looked like

Ok. The dialogue looked like this:

&gt;""There is no evidence of collusion.""

Simple stuff.

&gt;There was an awful lot of smoke being reported by reputable sources, and there's not a single piece that NYT or WaPo or WSJ reported on the Trump-Rusiia front that Mueller Report disproved.

[You're wrong.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/donald-trump-russia-collusion-cia.html)

[I can do this all day.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/17/yes-there-was-collusion-now-what-will-we-do-about-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d7340256626f)

[There are literally dozens of articles.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/not-true-james-comey-denounces-nyt-report-on-trump-campaign-collusion-with-russia-during-testimony)

(Made sure to use WaPo and NYT articles just for you - there are plenty more, too - just let me know if you need them.)

&gt;So all the stuff that happened that caused us to call for an investigation is shit that *really did happen*.

[You mean a false report that was debunked mid investigation?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

&gt;The softening of the RNC platform, the multiple attempts to establish communication backdoors, the contact between Sessions and Kislayak, and him suibsequently lying about it, a ton of other Trump staffers and Trump himself getting caught lying about contact with Russians - all that was real.

\[Sources please.\]

&gt;What's not real is the characterization that there was ""no collusion"" according to the Mueller report. The accurate characterization is that there wasn't enough admissible evidence to indict for it. Here's what the report has to say on the subject in its opening paragraphs:

That's some hard-core mental gymnastics for a huge nothing burger. Try harder. Your opinion is irrelevant. Meullers isn't. And Meuller said: ""No Evidence of Collusion.""

No matter what you may think constitute evidence... it's irrelevant. Meuller found none and your opinion on the matter is now irrelevant. Thanks for sharing it, though.

&gt;The report proceeds to name Flynn, Papadopolous, Cohen and Manafort as those who got charged.

Are you pretending that these people are guilty of collusion? Because literally none were charged with anything remotely resembling collusion.

&gt;That's not a determination that there was no collusion/coordination/conspiracy. That's ""we investigated the campaign and found enough dirt to indict the campaign manager and his right-hand guy along with Flynn and Papadop. Everyone else covered their tracks well enough that we can't bring a case against them.""

If you investigate a murder and find out that the suspect and his buddies are drug dealers... you arrest them for dealing drugs. But that doesn't mean they're murderers.

In this case: If you investigate collusion and find evidence of Tax Fraud (from years prior and not associated with a ""Russian Collusion"" investigation) you arrest them for their crimes - but that doesn't mean you get to label them as a traitor.

You're trying really hard to make 2+2=5.

&gt;Then of course it's followed by a second half of the report that says ""by the way, here's an open-and-shut case on the president obstructing the everloving shit out of our investigation. Did we mention that's a federal felony? Hey Congress, time for you guys to do your job.""

You must have a gold medal for the Mental Gymnastic Olympics.  Do you know how quotes work? Because that was literally never said. You're paraphrasing with a ridiculous bias. You're painting "" ***The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him***,' as ""he is clearly guilty.""

That is blatantly false. It's about as neutral a statement as one can get (and mine is the actual quote).

Look - it's clear you're chomping at the bit to get Trump with something... but why?

What is your obsession with finding him doing something wrong? What would have to happen for you to rethink your position? What event would need to take place in order for you to take a critical look at the treatment of the President of the United States?",1
"Try this:

"Strawman bullshit I perfectly understand what is at stake and believe the Bolivarian Rev needs to be protected, except unlike tankies i dont pretend there are no contradictions. Also regarding Rojava, its realpolitik without arial support the YPG would be in trouble, what else can you do? The Taliban took aid from the US when they needed it and it doesn't mean they are Imperialist or that they didn't later end up confronting the US.",1

King's Road to me is the pinnacle of storytelling in wrestling. So many people want the Attitude era to come back...but when you go back and watch it now, it was complete and utter garbage outside of a few guys. New Japan of the last 4 or 5 years is the only thing that can equal prime AJPW. Unfortunately, there are a lot of closed minded people who cant get over the language barrier or production or whatever. I'm hoping AEW can craft that type of long term storytelling (a tall, tall order) and put it into a package that your average American wrestling fan is willing to watch.

YTA if the baby screams non stop the parents are obviously aware of it and likely extremely exhausted in which case moving is gonna be difficult and likely make the baby more unsettled. Secondly reporting family's to DCF or other human/ family service takes away time and funding from people who actually need it. They came straight away because it was a baby while older children on terrible living conditions miss out on resources,1

"I had a lads holiday in Spain last year and we had two run ins with the police, both times we were doing something wrong.

I have to say their standard of professionalism is outstanding, they didn't take anything personally or insult us they just gave us a warning on the first occasion and I had to pay a fine on the second occasion. Both times we left feeling like it was totally fair and reasonable and with no bad feelings towards the cops.

Considering how much shit they have to put up with from British tourists I was really impressed by their behaviour and frankly think British police could learn a lot from them.",1

Lmao this thread is dumb,1
"First, this article is bunk because no matter whether a president can or can't be indicted, Mueller was never going to stray from DOJ policy.

Second, a sitting president can't be indicted. The executive branch is in charge of carrying out and enforcing the laws Congress creates. if a president committed a crime, ultimately it would fall to that very same president, as the highest level of authority of the executive branch, to decide whether or not to indict and prosecute that case. 

Seems like most presidents would just excuse their own crimes since they'd have that self autonomy.

Which is why they have the check of the House being able to impeach a charge and the Senate then convicting, with subsequent removal from office.

I'm pretty sure that our original government framers were capable of seeing the ridiculousness of what would be the president prosecuting himself essentially.

What they definitely didn't see becoming a reality is Congress becoming a corporately sponsored hyper partisan body that over the years regularly grinds to a halt on a regular basis due to disagreements across party lines.",1

Therefore, I have not equated anyone to racial stereotypes as, once again, nowhere did I mention race, but also just because there are no longer any Jim Crow laws doesn't mean that some people still don't suffer from poverty.

"First question: I don’t think we know. Maybe they had dragonglass and ahraks but once the ahraks are on fire they just kept them. If this still bothers you the episode provides no answer. 

2,3,4 : the answer, in story, is that the characters are bad at tactics. I’m apparently a unicorn because I liked the episode, but I don’t actually have an excuse. Out of the story the answer is: to look cool.

5: ghost is alive, the episode didn’t tell us that, though, he was in the preview. 

6: it’s not the time, it’s the middle of a battle.

7: because the options are to use the dragons and maybe die or not use them and definitely die. 

8: to draw out the NK. that’s actually explained. 

9,10: characters dumb/lucky

11: the dragon fire from 8.

Just because he is a man does not mean he cnt do this job. You are saying because of his gender he is unable to do something? Ironic as that is something this club is pushing against. Just because he wants to president doesnt mean the club will revolve around him. A good president and leader will make the club revolve around the mission of the club and not themselves. In addition there are no women wanting to stand up to fill this position, so would it be better to have the club dissolve with no leadership or have a leader that cares about the mission but happens to be male.",1

He had tick paralysis. We brought him home &amp; fixed him up &amp; kept him. He would eat our chickens though so we had to keep him tied up which we hated to do but had no other choice because he was ravenous. He'd eat the whole bird; beak, feathers, feet, everything, if he could get to them. I thought maybe he had jumped out of a truck &amp; got his face messed up or something but now that I'm older I think maybe he was a 'bait' dog for dog fighting as it was prevalent where we lived.

but I digress

retail is absolutely physically exploitative. good friend of mine needed a full knee replacement as a teenager bc the stepladder broke underneath them while retrieving 50 pound bags of cat litter from the top shelf (those bags aren't stackable so management liked to have them up top). management didn't pay a cent cause they had provided a too-short stepladder, forcing them to use that top step that's ""not a step."" that way, when it DID break, they could say the worker knowingly did something unsafe &amp; is responsible. she continued to work there &amp; in fact works there to this day bc she got kicked out for being gay, so no choice. she interviewed other places but the management of her current job told them all she sued them for workman's comp so none of them would hire her. oh, and her pay got docked. she picked up another 2 very similar, very low-paying jobs to make up for it.

another friend from further back, somewhere around 12, was working under the table for an uncle who wanted her at the shop doors at 4am so she could get things ready for him to open before she went to school every day &amp; then close for him every night. she took drugs to counter the sleep deprivation &amp; walked to the store alone, in the dark. her parents were abusive &amp; made her pay rent, so she couldn't quit.

5: ghost is alive, the episode didn’t tell us that, though, he was in the preview.

7: because the options are to use the dragons and maybe die or not use them and definitely die.

"I’d like to point out something that everyone seems to be skipping. Your daughter’s biological mother is the one who skipped out on Mother’s Day with her child. It’s funny how no one is calling her a cunt or an asshole or saying she’s horrible for not spending Mother’s Day with the child she actually birthed and raised. You don’t even seem upset about that.....but you are angry with your wife, who has only been a step-parent for 3.5 years and only sees your daughters 4 days a month. 

Have you considered that given the length of your marriage and the age of your kids, your daughters likely have never really seen your wife in a motherly role and vice versa? That’s pretty normal. I see it all the time in posts written by step-kids. “I have a mom/dad. I don’t need another one.” “My stepmom is always trying to act like she can tell me what to do.” “My stepdad needs to back off. I don’t need his advice.” Blending families when the kids are preteens and teens doesn’t work like it does when kids are young, especially if Mom or Dad are still fully involved. Parental relationships don’t develop as naturally, if at all. A “fun aunt” or friendly type relation tends to happen in healthy households instead. 

There’s just a lot of information missing from this post. What kind of relationship does your wife have with your daughters? Is she close with them? Has she made overtures? Have they indicated at any time they see her as a mother? Has there been serious tension or bad experiences? Has she been given a motherly role in your daughter’s life? Do you and your ex allow your wife to actually parent? Is she involved in decision making as equally? Would your daughter have wanted to spend Mother’s Day with your wife if her biological mother was available? Has your daughter ever even acknowledged your wife on Mothers day before? 

Depending on the answer to any of those questions, your wife could be being perfectly reasonable or a total asshole. Either way, it’s not particularly fair for you to expect her to “fill-in” because biomom is busy doing something else.",1

"That's absolutely incorrect;

""A 46,XY mother who developed as a normal woman underwent spontaneous puberty, reached menarche, menstruated regularly, experienced two unassisted pregnancies, and gave birth to a 46,XY daughter with complete gonadal dysgenesis...

Herein we report the extraordinary case of *a fertile woman* with normal ovaries and a *predominantly 46,XY ovarian karyotype*, who gave birth to a 46,XY female with complete gonadal dysgenesis. The karyotype of this phenotypically normal mother was 46,XY in blood, 80% 46,XY and 20% 45,X in cultured skin fibroblasts, and 93% 46,XY, 6% 45,X, and &lt;1% 46,XX in the ovary. The family pedigree on the mother’s side was notable for the presence of seven individuals over four generations with either sexual ambiguity, infertility, or failure to menstruate, including one individual with documented 45,X/45,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Both the mother and the 46,XY daughter were screened for mutations in a number of genes known to be involved in mammalian testis determination. In all genes screened (see below), the open reading frame was found to be normal. This suggests that a mutation in a novel sex-determination gene or a gene that predisposes to chromosomal mosaicism may be responsible for the phenotype in this family...

Maternity testing was performed by using the short tandem repeat kit AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nine short tandem repeats were analyzed (D3S1358, VWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) using thermal cycling conditions, capillary electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and products were analyzed using the ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis instrument and GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems).""

Honestly, the dragons alone would suffice in defeating the army of the dead in an open field.  Obviously, the show wouldn't show something as anticlimactic as the dragons defeating the army of the dead single-handedly, but it goes to show the whole battle sequence makes no sense.  I honestly don't think the Others would be that stupid to mount a direct attack in an open field if they knew their opponent had dragons.  I also don't think the living would be that stupid to field an army that will only be overwhelmed and added to the army of the dead.  Both opponents made dumbass decisions in this show.",0

I love a lot of the heroines, and they're strong enough characters on their own that Disney doesn't need to shove their female identity in our faces.

Furthermore we’ve already seen Thanos use it on the Vision without creating a different universe and we know the above since the Scarlet Witch witnesses the above, is not moved in time, and reacts accordingly. I suppose that with the time stone one is able to choose a point in time and allow that to connect to the present instead.

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0

Also, you can't forget my original point. They'd have to make panda champion with original mechanics and appealing playstyle and keep it somehow panda themed. There is always a chance of making another Ivern or Kled. However, there are champions with stable playerbase that look good in basically any theme and giving them a panda skin will be a certain profit.",0

"I’m not trying to even make this a generational thing, but unfortunately OP did. I’m sorry, but no. Tinder =/= “pioneer of hookup culture”.   

Everyone was on all the dating apps, regardless of their advertised use, for hooking up, despite their profiles saying otherwise.    

Ffs, Ashley Madison was started in 2001, a year before Tinder. Match was already a thing for a while, wiki says it started in 1995.   

And then there’s bars and clubs. Something that was happening for decades before online dating was a thing.   

I’m sorry but I can’t agree because I lived through it. You don’t get to take ownership for “hookup culture” just because a website was created to meet the growing need of something that was already happening.    

Tinder didn’t invent the hookup, it was just a reaction to the growing market.",0

"So many of your questions were answered, though. Bran was observing the battle through the crows to make sure everything continued to line up, that's why he followed the night king, and that is why he looked past the night king to make sure Arya was there.
The dagger was Valaryan steal, which the show said multiple times kills White walkers (Jon even killed one).
The Night king was created by the children of the forest to destroy mankind. The night king interpreted that as removing mankind from the world, which included killing Bran, who effectively held the entire knowledge of humanity with him.
Melisandre was there, like Berrick and the hound, to fulfill the prophecy and help Arya on her way to killing the Night King. She was the one who told Arya she was supposed to go after him.
Why would the Wights risk fighting personally when the entire Castle is outfitted with the only two things that could kill them? THAT would have been some seriously bad writing. It would make more sense to let your massive replenishing horde desimate the castle THEN go in a take out Bran (would suck if there were a trained assassin waiting to ambush you, but what chance is there of that happening, amiright?)

"""I love it,"" he says. ""I love the hitting. I love making the big play. I love being out there with my teammates. I love the camaraderie. I can't say I always love practice. But it's a means to an end. I want to have those big performances, those games you talk about years down the line. I want to win those big playoff games. I want to win a Super Bowl. I want to hold up the trophy. I want to splash Champagne on my teammates. I want to take care of my family for generations. I want to have my head turned into a bust in the Hall of Fame.

""Those things can only happen if I'm doing the best I can each and every day, looking out for my teammates and keeping out of trouble.""

Former Browns defensive line coach Clyde Simmons says Garrett ""has a chance to be one of the greats, as long as he stays healthy and continues to work on his craft."" In January, Simmons, who played defensive end in an era when nasty was a prerequisite for his position, also said he thinks there are ""some little things in there that I think he could be a little bit more aggressive about, a little nastier about.""

To which Garrett says: ""I'm the kind of guy who is always respectful of the game. I want to beat you, but I don't want to do anything dirty. I want to do it the clean way. You don't want to do something that hurts the team.""

During practices one fall at Texas A&amp;M, 6'5"", 325-pound offensive tackle Germain Ifedi grew frustrated after repeatedly being shown up by Garrett. On one play, Garrett long-armed the blocker, and his arm slid up to his throat. Ifedi, who now is with the Seahawks, threw a punch. Garrett avoided it. Then Ifedi charged Garrett.

Instead of fighting back, Garrett extended his arm, grabbed Ifedi's facemask and held him at bay. Ifedi kept swinging but couldn't connect.

That's Garrett—thoughtful and forceful at once.

Garrett realizes the mind is a powerful thing, even in a physical confrontation. Thomas helped him understand how to be a thinking man's defensive end by studying the offensive tackle Garrett would oppose each week during his rookie year. Thomas would  then give him three moves he thought could exploit his weaknesses.

""The nicest thing I can say about him is he's got the brain of an offensive lineman,"" Thomas says. ""He's not like your typical dumb defensive lineman. He's cerebral and thoughtful, and that really helps with the way he attacks offensive linemen.""

The forces within Garrett are not oppositional. They are complementary, yin and yang.

This is how he sees it: ""I'm caring and loving and supportive of people who have been forces in my life and have guided me where I am today. But football is my job. If I lose my job, I can't be supportive of the people who have been there for me. The person in front of me is trying to take my job. I have to whup him, or he beats me and takes my job. I'm not going to let that happen. I'm not out there to injure anybody, but I'm out there to hurt your will and make sure you don't want to do it anymore, take away your will to keep on fighting.""

Of course, like any good poet, he has a vision.

He can become one of the legends of the game, like Lawrence Taylor. ""I want to have the same impact on the game as LT,"" he says. ""That's big talk because he's one of the best ever. But it's doable.

""I want to go down as the greatest player to ever play.""",1

"I have my Vizio 55” LED I bought in 2012 (then $400) set on factory “Calibrated” settings and I could see everything just fine. 

Just to test things out, I even went through and set my TV on every other factory preset available (roughly 5 different presets) and they were all extremely dark like all the complaints I’ve seen about it. 

I’m not trying to say this guy is 100% right but it is possible that a good bit of viewers have their settings on too dark and just don’t know.

"I do not see this as valid criticism. I actually see this as criticism for the sake of criticism. Just because none of the 10 fan theories you read came to be true, doesn’t mean you start finding flaws where there aren’t any lol.

Why did the main characters survive? Think about it strong and hard, what possible explanation could there be for Brienne, Jon, Danny, tormund, jamie to survive? Well it’s because all of these guys are exceptional warriors and have been portrayed as such throughout the show (exception Danny but she has dragons lol). Throughout the show, each and every one of these individuals has been shown to be more courageous, more determined, more skilled than the others at combat. If any one survived, it should be these people.

Jorah mormont survives the first charge because he is a more accomplished warrior compared to the dothrakis - there is nothing that should be surprising here. Greyworm survived because he is the leader of the unsullied and why is that? Because he is the best of the unsullied.

Jon and Danny survived because they had dragons and weren’t part of the battle for the most part.

Bran survived because he had a full blown mini army protecting him, plus a certain Arya who is perhaps one of the most accomplished assassins ever to set foot in Westeros.

Why did Tyrion and Sansa survive, because they were the smartest of the people in the crypt and took shelter and hid when others did not think to do so.

I mean if you’re going to talk about plot armor, how the fuck did the night king not die of dragon fire when Danny smoked his ass? I see no one complaining about that.

Yes, the battle of winterfell wasn’t perfect but, for anything that hyped, how can it even be perfect? Out of tens of millions watching the show, there were always going to be subsets who were going to have issues with the story and the plot.

All the people complaining right now, it just makes no sense to me because if you want to talk about plot armor, each and every character has been in extremely dangerous situations before and guess what, they all made it to the last season.  I guess what you folks really wanted is for everyone to die in season 3 lol.",1

"So basically its too hard to fix the problem so lets not bother?

Banning guns and getting them off the street wont happen overnight anywhere, much less USA. But eventually getting rid of as many as possible will cause a big drop in these mass shootings I'd suspect.

We had the Port Arthur massacre in 1996. Following this, 640,000 guns were taken off the streets. Since then, we've had a mass shooting involving a single family in Perth (either this year or last IIRC), and the Lindt cafe seige in 2014, by a terrorist. We've had absolutely nothing on the scale of the sorts of attacks frequently happening in America. Its really not that complicated.

Sure, theres still illegal guns floating around the country, and they'll never get every single gun off the streets, but for the most part all we hear of here in Kangarooville are drug dealers being caught with the odd gun here and there. They're not out shooting up schools every day though so...",1
"&gt;First, let's recall what that dialog looked like

Ok. The dialogue looked like this:

&gt;""There is no evidence of collusion.""

Simple stuff.

&gt;There was an awful lot of smoke being reported by reputable sources, and there's not a single piece that NYT or WaPo or WSJ reported on the Trump-Rusiia front that Mueller Report disproved.

[You're wrong.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/donald-trump-russia-collusion-cia.html)

[I can do this all day.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/17/yes-there-was-collusion-now-what-will-we-do-about-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d7340256626f)

[There are literally dozens of articles.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/not-true-james-comey-denounces-nyt-report-on-trump-campaign-collusion-with-russia-during-testimony)

(Made sure to use WaPo and NYT articles just for you - there are plenty more, too - just let me know if you need them.)

&gt;So all the stuff that happened that caused us to call for an investigation is shit that *really did happen*.

[You mean a false report that was debunked mid investigation?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

&gt;The softening of the RNC platform, the multiple attempts to establish communication backdoors, the contact between Sessions and Kislayak, and him suibsequently lying about it, a ton of other Trump staffers and Trump himself getting caught lying about contact with Russians - all that was real.

\[Sources please.\]

&gt;What's not real is the characterization that there was ""no collusion"" according to the Mueller report. The accurate characterization is that there wasn't enough admissible evidence to indict for it. Here's what the report has to say on the subject in its opening paragraphs:

That's some hard-core mental gymnastics for a huge nothing burger. Try harder. Your opinion is irrelevant. Meullers isn't. And Meuller said: ""No Evidence of Collusion.""

No matter what you may think constitute evidence... it's irrelevant. Meuller found none and your opinion on the matter is now irrelevant. Thanks for sharing it, though.

&gt;The report proceeds to name Flynn, Papadopolous, Cohen and Manafort as those who got charged.

Are you pretending that these people are guilty of collusion? Because literally none were charged with anything remotely resembling collusion.

&gt;That's not a determination that there was no collusion/coordination/conspiracy. That's ""we investigated the campaign and found enough dirt to indict the campaign manager and his right-hand guy along with Flynn and Papadop. Everyone else covered their tracks well enough that we can't bring a case against them.""

If you investigate a murder and find out that the suspect and his buddies are drug dealers... you arrest them for dealing drugs. But that doesn't mean they're murderers.

In this case: If you investigate collusion and find evidence of Tax Fraud (from years prior and not associated with a ""Russian Collusion"" investigation) you arrest them for their crimes - but that doesn't mean you get to label them as a traitor.

You're trying really hard to make 2+2=5.

&gt;Then of course it's followed by a second half of the report that says ""by the way, here's an open-and-shut case on the president obstructing the everloving shit out of our investigation. Did we mention that's a federal felony? Hey Congress, time for you guys to do your job.""

You must have a gold medal for the Mental Gymnastic Olympics.  Do you know how quotes work? Because that was literally never said. You're paraphrasing with a ridiculous bias. You're painting "" ***The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him***,' as ""he is clearly guilty.""

That is blatantly false. It's about as neutral a statement as one can get (and mine is the actual quote).

Look - it's clear you're chomping at the bit to get Trump with something... but why?

What is your obsession with finding him doing something wrong? What would have to happen for you to rethink your position? What event would need to take place in order for you to take a critical look at the treatment of the President of the United States?",1

"&gt; There are a lot of misconceptions about these women that are holding them back. People think they've slept with 1000's of men, that they likely have diseases, that they are criminals, that they are probably drug addicts who have become somewhat violent and dangerous as a survival mechanism and have lost touch with the moral norms of society... These are all true,

I married a woman who lied about her history and what she had been up to for most of her life. Believe me, she hid it quite well. There were clues I missed because I lacked context and experience but just the same, from time to time in the year and a half I knew her before getting married she occasionally let slip comments that a more knowledgeable person would have or could have picked up on. Tracing back to through her history and occasional comments, hiring a PI to follow her around when I wasn't home and literally catching her in the act, I had to face the fact she had been a prostitute and still was an active prostitute. She secretly continued using drugs which I found out when I had to call an ambulance after an overdose and her son retrieved the barbiturate container which we showed EMS so they could treat her effectively, and then she blamed me for causing her to use drugs. She would become violent for no particular reason, she was a chronic and skilled liar, she defrauded the immigration system to get here and in the end was hit with an annulment based on fraud and deported with her son. She did lose touch with any form of ethics and social norms. It's not that she didn't know what right and wrong was, she just didn't care. To her, she didn't mind doing anything so long as she wasn't caught. When caught, she declared I was stupid with all my ethics, like, not lying and stealing from family, friends and your spouse. Oh, and not seeing the benefits of prostitution and getting into her ""business"". Even the judge slammed her on these issues. Oh, she talked so sweet and sounded so nice, like the sweet little victim as her attorney fell for her sweet talk and defended her enthusiastically. On the last day of hearings when we brought out all the documents that showed she was lying to everyone including the federal government her own attorney finally realized how badly he'd been misled. He actually believed her. I even felt a bit of pity for him when in utter disgust he threw his carefully thought out notes on the table in disgust. As for her, I felt no pity when I saw the look of shock on her face as the judge granted me annulment based on fraud and slammed his gavel down. Everything she had worked and schemed for destroyed in that moment. I didn't even feel bad when I learned she had been deported. She had her chance and blew it. You can take the whore off the streets but you can't make a whore into a wife or a respectable citizen. The only misconception  here is thinking there are misconceptions. No, society has this right.",1

but I digress

retail is absolutely physically exploitative. good friend of mine needed a full knee replacement as a teenager bc the stepladder broke underneath them while retrieving 50 pound bags of cat litter from the top shelf (those bags aren't stackable so management liked to have them up top). management didn't pay a cent cause they had provided a too-short stepladder, forcing them to use that top step that's ""not a step."" that way, when it DID break, they could say the worker knowingly did something unsafe &amp; is responsible. she continued to work there &amp; in fact works there to this day bc she got kicked out for being gay, so no choice. she interviewed other places but the management of her current job told them all she sued them for workman's comp so none of them would hire her. oh, and her pay got docked. she picked up another 2 very similar, very low-paying jobs to make up for it.

another friend from further back, somewhere around 12, was working under the table for an uncle who wanted her at the shop doors at 4am so she could get things ready for him to open before she went to school every day &amp; then close for him every night. she took drugs to counter the sleep deprivation &amp; walked to the store alone, in the dark. her parents were abusive &amp; made her pay rent, so she couldn't quit.

"This whole thread is ignoring the serious moral question. Should society be glad that someone is dead because he committed a crime. I frankly don't understand what stand your ground laws have to with this thread which started when someone commented  ""I am glad he is dead."" Obviously it's not ethical to burglarize someone's house and the action is not excusable at all and it was entirely his choice to enter her home and he had to face the consequences of that. But when someone says ""I am glad he is dead"" it is basically saying that this is the best possible outcome? Is that really the case?

I feel the appropriate response to this should be ""it's unfortunate that she had to kill someone but I am glad she was able to defend her property. Not ""I am glad he is dead.""",1

"I wasn’t saying that dragons in and of themselves existing is the unbelievable thing. Dragons should not exist because they’d collapse under their own weight. It has nothing to do with magic, that’s just science and logic. Same thing with a skeleton hand punching through solid rock. It’s all the same rules of reality that govern gravity, survivability in combat, and the relatively sharpness of weaponry. If those things are okay, then so should someone managing to disentangle themselves from a swarm with the use of their one-shot zombie lightsabers and the aid of close-by allies. Otherwise, you’re utilizing *selective suspension,* where something’s that break reality and logic and somethings aren’t just because you wanted to see some more dead main characters. 

That’s my thing. The more I hear people saying it’s a matter of believability and physics and whatever, the more it just doesn’t add up because if you actually cared about these characters and their struggles and stories and lives, then the fact they did survive despite these insurmountable odds should be joyous. Instead it seems like it matters more that fucking Isaac Newton’s math homework should be respected and just *bitch, bitch, bitch.* If you like these people and this story, then why it is such a big deal? Why the endless debates? Especially when there’s not been a precedent for major characters dying in battle, and statistically speaking, that’s when a main character is the safest. Name me a main character or major supporting character who has died in the thick of battle like everyone seemed to expect this episode. There was Ygritte. That’s the only one who comes to my mind.

I understand it’s an issue, maybe they should have shot those scenes to be less dogpile-y or Arya’s leap should be shorter or whatever else, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad writing or a bad story. It’s bad math and bad physics, but math and physics and even *logic herself* are not the rulers of Story-Town. They can advise on some things, but they do not make the final call. Even in Game of Thrones, they’ve never made the final call. And if that’s your primary concern when it comes to stories, then maybe you need to re-examine your priories.",1

This is Star Wars level of nitpicking(minus the racist/sexist comments to the actors on twitter). Half of reddit is complaining about dumb stuff like oh it’s too dark, oh this battle strategy in this fantasy show isn’t realistic, after years of subversion and having main characters die; they subvert is again by not having one main character die. As for the “someone dies if they make mistakes”, this isn’t true, many people have been ex machina’d many times in S1-4. Jon should have died in seasons 1-4, Dany should have died in the slave arena and Samwell sure as shit should have died in S1-4 so I don’t wanna hear mistakes would always lead to death when that’s not true",1

Too right you don't know enough to have an opinion. It's been non stop American backed coups for twenty years, including the 2002 coup where rouge elements of the army overthrew the government and arrested Chavez. After that failed they tried more subtle means of economic disruption.

Why should she have to go along with his lifestyle/passions/etc. rather than him going with hers? Or even just respecting the difference in preferences? There's nothing wrong with wanting a partner that shares in your passions or hobbies, but when you expect them to go along with it even when they seem clearly uncomfortable with it (and especially given that OP is not overweight, though I know I can't see her to understand how she carries her weight, understand that a doctor isn't going to give her the BMI talk), you're setting the relationship up for failure. The means he's going about it is wildly inappropriate. I simply don't see how this is a failure on her part for ""not trying something new"". Nobody should have to participate in a lifestyle or behavior just because their partner does, or even because their partner ""really wants them to try."" 

When I see posts like this, generally I think OP is looking for validation for ending the relationship. Seems like OP did try to communicate to her husband how his actions made her feel and all he did was dismiss her concerns and apparently turn it around on her? I think this relationship is a lost cause, no matter which way you spin it. But I don't think it's because of OP's actions.",0
"So many of your questions were answered, though. Bran was observing the battle through the crows to make sure everything continued to line up, that's why he followed the night king, and that is why he looked past the night king to make sure Arya was there.
The dagger was Valaryan steal, which the show said multiple times kills White walkers (Jon even killed one).
The Night king was created by the children of the forest to destroy mankind. The night king interpreted that as removing mankind from the world, which included killing Bran, who effectively held the entire knowledge of humanity with him.
Melisandre was there, like Berrick and the hound, to fulfill the prophecy and help Arya on her way to killing the Night King. She was the one who told Arya she was supposed to go after him.
Why would the Wights risk fighting personally when the entire Castle is outfitted with the only two things that could kill them? THAT would have been some seriously bad writing. It would make more sense to let your massive replenishing horde desimate the castle THEN go in a take out Bran (would suck if there were a trained assassin waiting to ambush you, but what chance is there of that happening, amiright?)

"Engagement rings are going to be more than just a wedding band, but there are ways to mitigate the costs (get a synthetic instead of a mined diamond for example). It really just depends on what your future partner wants and what you, as a couple, are comfortable with. 

I spent a little over 13k on the engagement ring (actually not that much higher than average for the state I live in), and we will probably spend between 1k and 2k each on the wedding bands. 

Honestly, it was more than I probably should have spent and more than she would have ever asked for in a million years,  but it was something that mattered to me, and I had the means to do it comfortably so I did it. It was satisfying to plan out and pay cash for such a purchase, and if I'm being completely honest about my own pettiness it was also gratifying to see her friends look jealous when she showed off her ring. 

Some tips I picked up when shopping for the diamond. Quality matters up to a point, then the differences start to matter only to jewelers and professionals. Focus more on getting decent quality in certain areas (cut, color, and clarity), and don't get hung up on the size (carat). A smaller, higher quality diamond is going to look nicer and like ""more"" than a large but shitty one. 

You should be able to put together a beautiful ring with your target budget. All that matters is that you and your future partner are happy with it!",0

"**Welcome  to part 3 of the coverage of the XFL. Before we start, I wanna state for the record I don’t necessarily agree with everything said here. As a mod for XFL subreddit, I want to see the league succeed. With that being said, let’s begin.**

**When we last left off, the XFL was still in development. Now, we’re in week 2. And already, we’re seeing signs of issues. First, here are a compilation of quotes from people in the wrestling business, some taken from the McMahon DVD and others being from miscellaneous. This is part 3 of a 5 part series I’m doing. Part 4 will cover Jesse Ventura’s friend (We’ll reveal who when we get there) and part 5 will cover the XFL’s close and also showcase the oral history SB Nation did on the XFL. Enjoy.**

Ivory: We were just pissed. We were pissed. I kept always saying ""I just wanna meet the guy who’s jersey and helmet came out of my paycheck"". You know, we try not to talk about money too much in our car rides but we decided, one car ride— I remember it was with Bob Holly and some other people— we decided that, across the board, all of our royalties had gone down by 10%. So, we were like ""Hmm…"" So, these damn guys better be doing it right because they’re running around on our cash. Our livelihoods.

Joey Styles: The first thing you saw when the first XFL game came on the air on a Saturday night on NBC was The Rock. It wasn’t about football at that point. The next thing I saw was Vince McMahon, himself, in an XFL jacket walking to midfield with his over-the-top Mr. McMahon voice saying

(Clip of Vince McMahon saying ""This is the XFL"" plays)

Joey Styles: And I think what happened was by not letting the XFL live on its own without any WWE personalities, all of the WWE hating media, right or wrong, jumped on the XFL. and if that didn’t do it, the cheerleaders surely did, because there was sure as hell a big difference between traditional football cheerleaders and the strippers that were cheerleading for the XFL grinding in those outfits.

Eric Bischoff: Had the XFL been a 3 year plan or a 5 year plan, I think it would probably be around today. It would’ve changed the sports industry as we know it.

Bob Costas: I think it should have been as obvious as steering clear of a dark alley in a dangerous neighborhood. Everything about it screamed to me schlock and crap. Everything that subsequently occurred validated that impression. In fairness, Dick Ebersol never asked me. None of the announcers who were associated with NBC were going to be used on this experiment, so there was never any danger of that.

Bruce Prichard: This is developed on the private jet on the way to the first game. On a Wednesday before the first game. We start talking about what we used to do as kids. We used to put a football in the middle of the street and line up at opposite ends and whoever got the football first started with it. It was street football, that’s how we played street football. ""I love it"", Vince said.

It wasn’t discussed with any football people, not discussed with any coaches or players or any input from the football experts — It’s Michael Hayes, Bruce Prichard, Brian Gerwitz, Stephanie McMahon, Vince McMahon, and Dick Ebersol. So we were like, ""What do we call that""? I think Michael Hayes came up with the name ""Scramble"".

**Also, before the XFL premiered, they shot a bunch of promos highlighting the cheerleaders. There was only one problem: they were all dancers. They touted the cheerleaders as having day jobs like one being a doctor and one being a teacher except they were all dancers. Here’s what Bruce Prichard said about that.**

Bruce Prichard: So, I end the meeting kind of abruptly and I grabbed this lady and I said ""What the fuck""? I can make shit work, but now I’ve got to go back and explain to Vince that I got a chick that likes to read math books, I got a chick that works at a lawyer office, a chick that used to work at a doctor’s office or a chick that wanted to be a lawyer and um…

Conrad: Two dozen dancers.

Bruce Prichard: They’re all dancers! And I said ""What the fuck?"" ""Well, tomorrow will be a better group"". ""I’ve got to shoot shit today!""

Conrad: Yeah

Bruce Prichard: So, essentially, I just made shit up.

(Conrad laughs hard)

Bruce Prichard: I took the bitch that worked at a lawyer’s office, I put her in a lawyer’s office, man. I had her be a lawyer.

Conrad: Coming in hot with that language.

Bruce Prichard: I had the one— oh, this is another good one. This was one, we’ve got a sport trainer or something like that. So, I go talk to her. She dateda trainer in high school. I said ""Well, great. You’re gonna be my athletic trainer"". I took the chick that liked to read math books— now, get this: she liked to read math books but she hated math and she couldn’t do any math problems. So, I had to have her go bring me one of those math books and we just did a complicated math problem on the wall. And here’s my favorite part of all. When we divvied up crews and everything, I said ""You know what? I’ll take these girls, Michael, you and Brian, you go take these girls, and you take your crew and I’ll do my crew"". Well, I made it so that my crew and all my girls, I could shoot everything right there at the stadium. I just did backstage stuff and I made a training room, I made a classroom, I just made shit up there. And Stephanie McMahon stayed with me and helped me produce and Michael and them were up until the wee hours of the morning having to shoot stuff on location in Las Vegas. It SUCKKKKKKED. Because they were just local dancers.",1

Regardless of if the guy was in a gang or not... shooting someone is murder. What’s your point here... if he thinks he is going to get off innocent why would he flee anyway?

And if we don’t hold potential murderers in jail then what are you suggesting? We let people who aren’t confirmed/convicted of murder roam around until their trial? Sounds like a good plan to have more people killed",1

"They have a huge market share and no serious competition, that's textbook monopoly. Not having exclusivity deals does not preclude it from being a monopoly. 

&gt;Inconvenient fact you probably dont want to hear. If epic did not want to create a monopoly, they would not sign exclusivity deals.

An inconvenient fact you probably don't want to hear. Epic doesn't want the federal government coming to shut them down, they want market shares not a monopoly. Exclusivity deals are a proven way to gain market shares in the entertainment industry, they're just building their brand. 

Signing exclusivity deals is not a sign of monopoly, where are you getting this idea from? Netflix is not a monopoly even though they are the only service that shows The Office. 

&gt;Then they would compete with steam by offering a better product at a better price.

They could also buy exclusives, there is more than one way to get games. Your suggestion is valid, so is epic's strategy.

I'm probably never going to use the Epic launcher since I don't play fornite and the services sound terrible, but its still good for them to put pressure on steam in some way. Consumers only have more to gain in the long run.",0

"First question: I don’t think we know. Maybe they had dragonglass and ahraks but once the ahraks are on fire they just kept them. If this still bothers you the episode provides no answer. 

2,3,4 : the answer, in story, is that the characters are bad at tactics. I’m apparently a unicorn because I liked the episode, but I don’t actually have an excuse. Out of the story the answer is: to look cool.

5: ghost is alive, the episode didn’t tell us that, though, he was in the preview. 

6: it’s not the time, it’s the middle of a battle.

7: because the options are to use the dragons and maybe die or not use them and definitely die. 

8: to draw out the NK. that’s actually explained. 

9,10: characters dumb/lucky

11: the dragon fire from 8.

"First, this article is bunk because no matter whether a president can or can't be indicted, Mueller was never going to stray from DOJ policy.

Second, a sitting president can't be indicted. The executive branch is in charge of carrying out and enforcing the laws Congress creates. if a president committed a crime, ultimately it would fall to that very same president, as the highest level of authority of the executive branch, to decide whether or not to indict and prosecute that case. 

Seems like most presidents would just excuse their own crimes since they'd have that self autonomy.

Which is why they have the check of the House being able to impeach a charge and the Senate then convicting, with subsequent removal from office.

I'm pretty sure that our original government framers were capable of seeing the ridiculousness of what would be the president prosecuting himself essentially.

What they definitely didn't see becoming a reality is Congress becoming a corporately sponsored hyper partisan body that over the years regularly grinds to a halt on a regular basis due to disagreements across party lines.",1

"So many of your questions were answered, though. Bran was observing the battle through the crows to make sure everything continued to line up, that's why he followed the night king, and that is why he looked past the night king to make sure Arya was there.
The dagger was Valaryan steal, which the show said multiple times kills White walkers (Jon even killed one).
The Night king was created by the children of the forest to destroy mankind. The night king interpreted that as removing mankind from the world, which included killing Bran, who effectively held the entire knowledge of humanity with him.
Melisandre was there, like Berrick and the hound, to fulfill the prophecy and help Arya on her way to killing the Night King. She was the one who told Arya she was supposed to go after him.
Why would the Wights risk fighting personally when the entire Castle is outfitted with the only two things that could kill them? THAT would have been some seriously bad writing. It would make more sense to let your massive replenishing horde desimate the castle THEN go in a take out Bran (would suck if there were a trained assassin waiting to ambush you, but what chance is there of that happening, amiright?)

Jayce animations are super smooth too, however, his voice does not match AT ALL with his new shonen style, hopefully, they can fix that, legit it sounds too mature for that face and body...

"&gt;I would say that there is a huge difference between what men looked in magazines in previous generations and the porn available today. When I was growing up friends would snake a Playboy or Penthouse from their parents, you had to be an adult to even buy them. Now, any person of any age can access all types of porn (rule 34) from wherever they are at any time of day.

Even then internet porn was a thing of the 90s and onwards. I could see whatever I wanted as a teen whenever I wanted. That gen are in their 30s now. The era of porn and the internet isn't new and the effects aren't just being seen. We're all getting married and having kids because that's the stage tons of us are at.

And do you think young adults in the 90s weren't doing that too? Or in the 00's? 

&gt;So while I believe that watching porn is a healthy and normal part of sexual development I also believe that unlimited access to it in an unsupervised and/or unregulated way can be detrimental to some young boys.

"This is purely hypothetical empty pro-sex work bag being lofted up by an anti-sex work sophist who wants some answers in what next.

No one here is going to say prostitution under a capitalist system is moral just like no one is arguing child labor under a capitalist system is moral (ethical utilitarian whatever) but if we can conceive the unicorn exists (I know people who like to do sex work and are self employed and choose their dates/films so yes exchanging your wellbeing for value in a capitalist system is immoral but the idea that some sex workers don’t enjoy their jobs is kind if puritan) then where does that unicorn fit into socialist society? Or are we saying she can’t possibly enjoy her work (we all know women hate sex). 

So yes it is exploitative to sell your body in a capitalist society no one has made the argument otherwise. The real question is what are you defining as sex therapy? How do you feel about brothel credits for the mentally deficient? Is that sex therapy or prostitution? Obviously it’s exploitation but where does the exploitation stop and the community ‘service’ begin.",1

"Homosexuals had to come a long way, for years being openly homosexual meant a life of poverty. Especially if you were male. It was through their hard work and integrity that got them to rise above.

True Indians and other Asians are immigrating here with a positive mindset, but they had to struggle through poverty as well. Hence the many businesses that we use to jokingly call Asian (dry cleaning, nail care) was just them trying to get their foot in the door, trusting that if they get their kids educated and focus them on success, they’ll live a happy life in the west. Because it can be overcome.

To me nobody is inherently criminal and poor in the west. What we are is responsible for our own choices, and we either accept that or we don’t. People that don’t fail, people that do succeed. I don’t think American society overall promotes people to be irresponsible, I think groups of people develop their pocket cultures and their pocket cultures promotes them to be irresponsible. And personally, I think those pocket cultures that promote irresponsible behavior are finally starting to erode. I think videos like this really point out that mindset and I’m sure now that guys family knows how they sound by now. Maybe it’s pride that keeps them from admitting it? At a guess anyhow.",1

"Do some 6-7 minute job matches. Make some midcarders look like bad asses for once. A much preferred alternative 50/50 booking. This would also lead to matches at PPVs not being something you've seen a hundred times before. You can use local indy guys as job guys or even call up the guys from the developmental center that can bump and slap a moustache on them.

Have a tournament for a title shot where you have a few matches each week leading up to a title shot at the PPV instead of trying to hot shot a feud every week and a half. This could easily eat up 30 minutes every week if they let the guys actually work. You can even make creatives lives easier as this is a simple route to set up storylines and feuds between wrestlers who have been eliminated from the tournament.

Have actual stables and show the relationships within them. The closest thing to a stable right now is the New Day, and it's weird to think WWE hasnt capitalized on this easy solution to sell mercy AND get more of their guys on TV. 

Show altercations and arguments between guys backstage. And let them do it without being asked questions by an interviewer and awkwardly reading pre-written answers off a teleprompter.

There's also quite a bit of talent that they keep off of the mic because they just aren't great talkers, which limits the amount of TV time those guys can get and limits the storylines you can give them. This problem is easily fixed by having actual old school managers!",0

"To your point, it’s interesting to note that the “original” first-person shooter video games (Wolfenstein 3D and Doom) were released in 1992 and 1993 respectively. These titles were revolutionary and made the entire “shooter” genre very popular. By the late 90s (when Columbine occurred), the games had become much more common, realistic and violent. To this day, First-person shooter games such as Call of Duty or Halo are among the most popular video games in America. 

Is it purely coincidental that young males started shooting their classmates shorty after we literally turned shooting people into a game? Many of the shooters have been reported to be avid fans of games of that genre. 

To expand upon this idea, I think it’s important to see that our problem with shootings in America is far to broad and complex to blame on any one issue. It is a combination of a fascination with murderers; a 24 hour news cycle that is desperate for ratings; a society that has become desensitized to violence through violent movies/shows/games; a worship of the military creating “wannabe soldiers”; a poor public education system; a poor mental health system;  and, yes, the wide availability of firearms. 

Many other factors work in as well, those are just some of the larger ones. Point is, there is no single issue to blame. Frequent shootings, be it gang violence, active shooters, accidents or suicides are a uniquely American problem due to a culmination of other unique American problems.",1

"OK, so this 12-year-old now knows that her dad cheated and is a shitty person. Now what? She’s going to be living with him for the next six years at least, she’s going to be emotionally invested in him likely for the rest of his life, while OP is basically going to be out of her life after this. 

What’s the actual benefit in her knowing the details of this? “Your dad is a shithead who cheated, btw bye see you never!” Great, so the child loses a person who was in her life, and now potentially thinks terribly of and doesn’t trust her actual parent. That’s just perfect! Where do things go from here? Surely up, for those rosy teenage years when nothing ever goes wrong!

OP basically got to drop a bomb and walk out in the aftermath. I am in no way justifying what happened to her. It completely sucks that this person she loved cheated on her, and what the dad did is complete shit. However, it’s not like OP is going to be around to do anything for this kid in the future.

People think they've slept with 1000's of men, that they likely have diseases, that they are criminals, that they are probably drug addicts who have become somewhat violent and dangerous as a survival mechanism and have lost touch with the moral norms of society... These are all true,

I married a woman who lied about her history and what she had been up to for most of her life. Believe me, she hid it quite well. There were clues I missed because I lacked context and experience but just the same, from time to time in the year and a half I knew her before getting married she occasionally let slip comments that a more knowledgeable person would have or could have picked up on. Tracing back to through her history and occasional comments, hiring a PI to follow her around when I wasn't home and literally catching her in the act, I had to face the fact she had been a prostitute and still was an active prostitute. She secretly continued using drugs which I found out when I had to call an ambulance after an overdose and her son retrieved the barbiturate container which we showed EMS so they could treat her effectively, and then she blamed me for causing her to use drugs. She would become violent for no particular reason, she was a chronic and skilled liar, she defrauded the immigration system to get here and in the end was hit with an annulment based on fraud and deported with her son. She did lose touch with any form of ethics and social norms. It's not that she didn't know what right and wrong was, she just didn't care. To her, she didn't mind doing anything so long as she wasn't caught. When caught, she declared I was stupid with all my ethics, like, not lying and stealing from family, friends and your spouse. Oh, and not seeing the benefits of prostitution and getting into her ""business"". Even the judge slammed her on these issues. Oh, she talked so sweet and sounded so nice, like the sweet little victim as her attorney fell for her sweet talk and defended her enthusiastically. On the last day of hearings when we brought out all the documents that showed she was lying to everyone including the federal government her own attorney finally realized how badly he'd been misled. He actually believed her. I even felt a bit of pity for him when in utter disgust he threw his carefully thought out notes on the table in disgust. As for her, I felt no pity when I saw the look of shock on her face as the judge granted me annulment based on fraud and slammed his gavel down. Everything she had worked and schemed for destroyed in that moment. I didn't even feel bad when I learned she had been deported. She had her chance and blew it. You can take the whore off the streets but you can't make a whore into a wife or a respectable citizen. The only misconception  here is thinking there are misconceptions. No, society has this right.",1
"It’s true. Businesses have pervaded the election process. 

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0 

This bas compelled to consider my own biases and I urge whoever else to do the same.",1
"People can shit on him for playing the race card, but I'm on his side on this. If he feels uncomfortable waiting on the hands and feet of a mostly white male roster because of his ancestry, then that's his truth, and sitting here and mocking him for it just proves his point that he needs to fight more for his own equality.",1
"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically. 

Peoples misconception of the arcs and mixing that with theories they’ve heard and prophecies they’ve taken either literally or misinterpreted is the problem here more than bad writing",1
"This subreddit has the fanboys going in full damage control mode at the moment. They are now saying things like “Lol who cares about twitch?” “Kids these days have no attention span because of EVIL FORTNITE” “this game isnt dead, a game is dead when it has NO players and you cant find a lobby!”. 

Yet during launch everyone seemed to *love* posting Twitch viewer stats between Apex and Fortnite, showing off how many Twitch viewers Apex had over fortnite. 

The truth is that this game has no new content so there is no reason to play it. A battle royale game getting nothing but a new character and a new gun in ~2 months is pretty bad. Not even a change to the map or any significant balance changes except for an overbuff to the Longbow.  

Battle royale games are repetitive. You’re playing running simulator for a good majority of the match FFS. It needs something to keep things entertaining.",1

Imagine if he starts Rose as a CM when Wanyama, Sissoko, Alli and Eriksen are all fit, coupled with Foyth at rb when Trippier and Rose are fit, and you get trounced (which this Ajax side are easily capable of doing). Poch would look like a fool. In a CL semi final. You just don’t do that at this stage. His hand was forced this match due to the injury to Kane and the suspension of Son.

"I do not see this as valid criticism. I actually see this as criticism for the sake of criticism. Just because none of the 10 fan theories you read came to be true, doesn’t mean you start finding flaws where there aren’t any lol.

Why did the main characters survive? Think about it strong and hard, what possible explanation could there be for Brienne, Jon, Danny, tormund, jamie to survive? Well it’s because all of these guys are exceptional warriors and have been portrayed as such throughout the show (exception Danny but she has dragons lol). Throughout the show, each and every one of these individuals has been shown to be more courageous, more determined, more skilled than the others at combat. If any one survived, it should be these people.

Jorah mormont survives the first charge because he is a more accomplished warrior compared to the dothrakis - there is nothing that should be surprising here. Greyworm survived because he is the leader of the unsullied and why is that? Because he is the best of the unsullied.

Jon and Danny survived because they had dragons and weren’t part of the battle for the most part.

Bran survived because he had a full blown mini army protecting him, plus a certain Arya who is perhaps one of the most accomplished assassins ever to set foot in Westeros.

Why did Tyrion and Sansa survive, because they were the smartest of the people in the crypt and took shelter and hid when others did not think to do so.

I mean if you’re going to talk about plot armor, how the fuck did the night king not die of dragon fire when Danny smoked his ass? I see no one complaining about that.

Yes, the battle of winterfell wasn’t perfect but, for anything that hyped, how can it even be perfect? Out of tens of millions watching the show, there were always going to be subsets who were going to have issues with the story and the plot.

All the people complaining right now, it just makes no sense to me because if you want to talk about plot armor, each and every character has been in extremely dangerous situations before and guess what, they all made it to the last season.  I guess what you folks really wanted is for everyone to die in season 3 lol.",1

but I digress

retail is absolutely physically exploitative. good friend of mine needed a full knee replacement as a teenager bc the stepladder broke underneath them while retrieving 50 pound bags of cat litter from the top shelf (those bags aren't stackable so management liked to have them up top). management didn't pay a cent cause they had provided a too-short stepladder, forcing them to use that top step that's ""not a step."" that way, when it DID break, they could say the worker knowingly did something unsafe &amp; is responsible. she continued to work there &amp; in fact works there to this day bc she got kicked out for being gay, so no choice. she interviewed other places but the management of her current job told them all she sued them for workman's comp so none of them would hire her. oh, and her pay got docked. she picked up another 2 very similar, very low-paying jobs to make up for it.

another friend from further back, somewhere around 12, was working under the table for an uncle who wanted her at the shop doors at 4am so she could get things ready for him to open before she went to school every day &amp; then close for him every night. she took drugs to counter the sleep deprivation &amp; walked to the store alone, in the dark. her parents were abusive &amp; made her pay rent, so she couldn't quit.

"I do not see this as valid criticism. I actually see this as criticism for the sake of criticism. Just because none of the 10 fan theories you read came to be true, doesn’t mean you start finding flaws where there aren’t any lol.

Why did the main characters survive? Think about it strong and hard, what possible explanation could there be for Brienne, Jon, Danny, tormund, jamie to survive? Well it’s because all of these guys are exceptional warriors and have been portrayed as such throughout the show (exception Danny but she has dragons lol). Throughout the show, each and every one of these individuals has been shown to be more courageous, more determined, more skilled than the others at combat. If any one survived, it should be these people.

Jorah mormont survives the first charge because he is a more accomplished warrior compared to the dothrakis - there is nothing that should be surprising here. Greyworm survived because he is the leader of the unsullied and why is that? Because he is the best of the unsullied.

Jon and Danny survived because they had dragons and weren’t part of the battle for the most part.

Bran survived because he had a full blown mini army protecting him, plus a certain Arya who is perhaps one of the most accomplished assassins ever to set foot in Westeros.

Why did Tyrion and Sansa survive, because they were the smartest of the people in the crypt and took shelter and hid when others did not think to do so.

I mean if you’re going to talk about plot armor, how the fuck did the night king not die of dragon fire when Danny smoked his ass? I see no one complaining about that.

Yes, the battle of winterfell wasn’t perfect but, for anything that hyped, how can it even be perfect? Out of tens of millions watching the show, there were always going to be subsets who were going to have issues with the story and the plot.

All the people complaining right now, it just makes no sense to me because if you want to talk about plot armor, each and every character has been in extremely dangerous situations before and guess what, they all made it to the last season.  I guess what you folks really wanted is for everyone to die in season 3 lol.",1

As an outsider it's insane to watch you Americans talk about everything else but the guns. Yes mental health is an issue, an even bigger issue is the rampant bullying and mean evil culture young people deem acceptable so long as violence isn't used.


You guys need a complete ban on semi Auto weapon and a huge change more like Australia or England to all firearms. 

Yes if someone wants to kill they use other methods but ease of availability and ease of use put guns at number one. I would bet my life the amount of mass murders that have happened in the last decade would be a drastically lower number if ten years ago these changes were strictly implemented. There is no denying this. Yes the black market exists but your average bullied loner, scorned lover or extreme ideolog doesn't hang with criminals and can't usually get an assault rifle from them.


You guys need to wake up and realise that second amendment was written during a completely different era of humanity to cover a completely different challenge and everyone just loves their guns so much they hide behind it. The rest of the world watches on with disgust.",1

"&gt;First, let's recall what that dialog looked like

Ok. The dialogue looked like this:

&gt;""There is no evidence of collusion.""

Simple stuff.

&gt;There was an awful lot of smoke being reported by reputable sources, and there's not a single piece that NYT or WaPo or WSJ reported on the Trump-Rusiia front that Mueller Report disproved.

[You're wrong.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/donald-trump-russia-collusion-cia.html)

[I can do this all day.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/17/yes-there-was-collusion-now-what-will-we-do-about-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d7340256626f)

[There are literally dozens of articles.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/not-true-james-comey-denounces-nyt-report-on-trump-campaign-collusion-with-russia-during-testimony)

(Made sure to use WaPo and NYT articles just for you - there are plenty more, too - just let me know if you need them.)

&gt;So all the stuff that happened that caused us to call for an investigation is shit that *really did happen*.

[You mean a false report that was debunked mid investigation?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

&gt;The softening of the RNC platform, the multiple attempts to establish communication backdoors, the contact between Sessions and Kislayak, and him suibsequently lying about it, a ton of other Trump staffers and Trump himself getting caught lying about contact with Russians - all that was real.

\[Sources please.\]

&gt;What's not real is the characterization that there was ""no collusion"" according to the Mueller report. The accurate characterization is that there wasn't enough admissible evidence to indict for it. Here's what the report has to say on the subject in its opening paragraphs:

That's some hard-core mental gymnastics for a huge nothing burger. Try harder. Your opinion is irrelevant. Meullers isn't. And Meuller said: ""No Evidence of Collusion.""

No matter what you may think constitute evidence... it's irrelevant. Meuller found none and your opinion on the matter is now irrelevant. Thanks for sharing it, though.

&gt;The report proceeds to name Flynn, Papadopolous, Cohen and Manafort as those who got charged.

Are you pretending that these people are guilty of collusion? Because literally none were charged with anything remotely resembling collusion.

&gt;That's not a determination that there was no collusion/coordination/conspiracy. That's ""we investigated the campaign and found enough dirt to indict the campaign manager and his right-hand guy along with Flynn and Papadop. Everyone else covered their tracks well enough that we can't bring a case against them.""

If you investigate a murder and find out that the suspect and his buddies are drug dealers... you arrest them for dealing drugs. But that doesn't mean they're murderers.

In this case: If you investigate collusion and find evidence of Tax Fraud (from years prior and not associated with a ""Russian Collusion"" investigation) you arrest them for their crimes - but that doesn't mean you get to label them as a traitor.

You're trying really hard to make 2+2=5.

&gt;Then of course it's followed by a second half of the report that says ""by the way, here's an open-and-shut case on the president obstructing the everloving shit out of our investigation. Did we mention that's a federal felony? Hey Congress, time for you guys to do your job.""

You must have a gold medal for the Mental Gymnastic Olympics.  Do you know how quotes work? Because that was literally never said. You're paraphrasing with a ridiculous bias. You're painting "" ***The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him***,' as ""he is clearly guilty.""

That is blatantly false. It's about as neutral a statement as one can get (and mine is the actual quote).

Look - it's clear you're chomping at the bit to get Trump with something... but why?

What is your obsession with finding him doing something wrong? What would have to happen for you to rethink your position? What event would need to take place in order for you to take a critical look at the treatment of the President of the United States?",1

""A 46,XY mother who developed as a normal woman underwent spontaneous puberty, reached menarche, menstruated regularly, experienced two unassisted pregnancies, and gave birth to a 46,XY daughter with complete gonadal dysgenesis...

Herein we report the extraordinary case of *a fertile woman* with normal ovaries and a *predominantly 46,XY ovarian karyotype*, who gave birth to a 46,XY female with complete gonadal dysgenesis. The karyotype of this phenotypically normal mother was 46,XY in blood, 80% 46,XY and 20% 45,X in cultured skin fibroblasts, and 93% 46,XY, 6% 45,X, and &lt;1% 46,XX in the ovary. The family pedigree on the mother’s side was notable for the presence of seven individuals over four generations with either sexual ambiguity, infertility, or failure to menstruate, including one individual with documented 45,X/45,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Both the mother and the 46,XY daughter were screened for mutations in a number of genes known to be involved in mammalian testis determination. In all genes screened (see below), the open reading frame was found to be normal. This suggests that a mutation in a novel sex-determination gene or a gene that predisposes to chromosomal mosaicism may be responsible for the phenotype in this family...

Maternity testing was performed by using the short tandem repeat kit AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nine short tandem repeats were analyzed (D3S1358, VWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) using thermal cycling conditions, capillary electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and products were analyzed using the ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis instrument and GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems).""

"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically. 

Peoples misconception of the arcs and mixing that with theories they’ve heard and prophecies they’ve taken either literally or misinterpreted is the problem here more than bad writing",1

"&gt; Objectively, TLJ can be called a good film.

see like... how? just cos it's competent on a technical, movie making level? just cos it made money? 

i can't think of a single thing in this movie that resonates emotionally. i'm not sure what the thesis it's pushing is supposed to be, the characters and their motivations get completely obliterated in service of being in the right place at the right time. in 2 movies (nearly 5 hours) there isn't even an arc for anyone outside of Rey who just kinda learns that the force exists. her arc, in fact, directly undermines her personal growth so that she can be there to save people with some force magic.

they spend these same movies to basically do a lap and come back to where we started: the resistance fighting the sith.... why are they still fighting? the movies don't even want to engage with this fundamental question that's supposed to be at the heart of why we're even watching and skip it entirely.

"It’s like we’re right back in 2016 with Bernie supporters telling POC’s that issues which specifically impact their communities don’t matter. A blanket answer of “I’m going to tell everyone racism isn’t tolerated and fix the economy” and “I marched with MLK that one time”, just feels like outright pandering at best, and at worst a complete lack of awareness or understanding of the plight minority groups face. Warren at least was able to offer policy initiatives in the form of addressing the severe disparity in maternal care for black women.

I’m sure there will also be the same dumbfounded reactions from his supporters as it was in 2016 when he again fails to capture votes from minority demographics. His supporters should instead of dismissing the concerns of minorities as “causing division”, or condescending remarks such as “who are they going to vote for trump” (we aren’t even in primary territory yet ffs), put aside their personal feelings and try to listen to their fellow voters concerns, and use that to actively push the campaign to craft a message and policy that addresses them. 

That said, *I* will still vote for whomever wins the primary, but I at least understand the apathy of minority voters who just see more of the same empty hollow promises and platitudes, and simply sit it out because things won’t change regardless, and instead only get worse.",1

"Once again, I ask how I'm ignorant?  No major religion, including Orthodox Judaism, is against vaccination. In fact, most take the stance that vaccinations are a moral imperative in order to protect not just one's children, but also other people who can't be vaccinated.

That means there has to be more going on here beyond the faith angle (other than the fact this community is tight-knit and spend a lot of time together, thereby increasing chances for disease transmission).  If you spend any time intercting with antivaxers on social media, you will see a very common link: they espouse bodily purity, ""clean"" eating and anything ""natural"": organic food, essential oils, chiropractic and homeopathy, that sort of thing.  All of that is out of reach for many low income households, as is traveling overseas (linked to the current NY outbreak) and going to theme parks (2015 Disneyland outbreak).

In the end, it is extremely privileged and selfish to refuse to take on the responsibility (and minimal risk) of vaccinating one's children while relying on herd immunity to do the job.  It is privileged for parents to deny their children the protection they more than likely themselves received as children.  It is privileged to bask in the luxury of vaccine refusal while parents in developing countries are desperate to vaccinate their children.",1

"&gt;The responses are crazy. There is a reason why sex stores only sell to 18+

What is that reason? Some would argue that it is because the are people who believe that youth under 18 shouldn't know anything about sex or sexuality. They may also consider such places to be perverse.

&gt;...isn't being overly sexual a sign of being sexually abused? Like ya kids start exploring at that age but I feel sex toys pushes it a bit too far.

Not really. It needs to be considered within an environmental context. The child is likely learning about sex in school and is curious. This is a sensitive period, and not a good time to shame them (if there is one).

&gt;Also if a 6th grader told her teacher or someone she trusted that her parents were buying her sex toys, CPS would be getting involved.

There may be questions since it isn't the norm. A social worker would want to determine the circumstances of the matter, but there wouldn't be an apprehension for allowing a child to explore their sexual development in a healthy way.",1

"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically.

"It’s true. Businesses have pervaded the election process. 

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0

She didn’t finish the training but she got the drop on Jaquen and bested the waif. They can’t show every little intricate detail of the training that she went through so they just showed the parts that looked good onscreen. She snuck up on Jon in broad daylight which I would say adds a little bit of difficulty. She also wasn’t attempting to assassinate him so I assume she was probably moving at a leisurely pace. The point of them showing causing that white walkers hair to move like that was to show that she was too quick to be noticed which is why they weren’t able to do anything.

"Has society really become so debased in recent times that we signal our respect to others by typing ""F""? How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - ""Call of Duty"", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and ""pressing F"". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice.

The karyotype of this phenotypically normal mother was 46,XY in blood, 80% 46,XY and 20% 45,X in cultured skin fibroblasts, and 93% 46,XY, 6% 45,X, and &lt;1% 46,XX in the ovary. The family pedigree on the mother’s side was notable for the presence of seven individuals over four generations with either sexual ambiguity, infertility, or failure to menstruate, including one individual with documented 45,X/45,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Both the mother and the 46,XY daughter were screened for mutations in a number of genes known to be involved in mammalian testis determination. In all genes screened (see below), the open reading frame was found to be normal. This suggests that a mutation in a novel sex-determination gene or a gene that predisposes to chromosomal mosaicism may be responsible for the phenotype in this family...

Maternity testing was performed by using the short tandem repeat kit AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nine short tandem repeats were analyzed (D3S1358, VWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) using thermal cycling conditions, capillary electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and products were analyzed using the ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis instrument and GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems).""

"&gt;A) correlation does not mean causation; there are many environmental factors that impact educational and intellectual capacities

And? the fact that there is a correlation already justifies the position. Every part of that statement is true. Low IQ parents are more likely to have low IQ children. 

&gt;B) none of these components that you guys claim are demonstrated to be based on genetics, they are environmentally-impacted

 People with low IQ's are more likely to get abortions - Doesn't do be a genetic factor that causes them to get abortions. Point is they are more likely to. 

IQ is strongly correlated with biological parents - This is based on genetics. See Heritability of Intelligence",1

"I do not see this as valid criticism. I actually see this as criticism for the sake of criticism. Just because none of the 10 fan theories you read came to be true, doesn’t mean you start finding flaws where there aren’t any lol.

Why did the main characters survive? Think about it strong and hard, what possible explanation could there be for Brienne, Jon, Danny, tormund, jamie to survive? Well it’s because all of these guys are exceptional warriors and have been portrayed as such throughout the show (exception Danny but she has dragons lol). Throughout the show, each and every one of these individuals has been shown to be more courageous, more determined, more skilled than the others at combat. If any one survived, it should be these people.

Jorah mormont survives the first charge because he is a more accomplished warrior compared to the dothrakis - there is nothing that should be surprising here. Greyworm survived because he is the leader of the unsullied and why is that? Because he is the best of the unsullied.

Jon and Danny survived because they had dragons and weren’t part of the battle for the most part.

Bran survived because he had a full blown mini army protecting him, plus a certain Arya who is perhaps one of the most accomplished assassins ever to set foot in Westeros.

Why did Tyrion and Sansa survive, because they were the smartest of the people in the crypt and took shelter and hid when others did not think to do so.

I mean if you’re going to talk about plot armor, how the fuck did the night king not die of dragon fire when Danny smoked his ass? I see no one complaining about that.

Yes, the battle of winterfell wasn’t perfect but, for anything that hyped, how can it even be perfect? Out of tens of millions watching the show, there were always going to be subsets who were going to have issues with the story and the plot.

All the people complaining right now, it just makes no sense to me because if you want to talk about plot armor, each and every character has been in extremely dangerous situations before and guess what, they all made it to the last season.  I guess what you folks really wanted is for everyone to die in season 3 lol.",1

"I’d like to point out something that everyone seems to be skipping. Your daughter’s biological mother is the one who skipped out on Mother’s Day with her child. It’s funny how no one is calling her a cunt or an asshole or saying she’s horrible for not spending Mother’s Day with the child she actually birthed and raised. You don’t even seem upset about that.....but you are angry with your wife, who has only been a step-parent for 3.5 years and only sees your daughters 4 days a month. 

Have you considered that given the length of your marriage and the age of your kids, your daughters likely have never really seen your wife in a motherly role and vice versa? That’s pretty normal. I see it all the time in posts written by step-kids. “I have a mom/dad. I don’t need another one.” “My stepmom is always trying to act like she can tell me what to do.” “My stepdad needs to back off. I don’t need his advice.” Blending families when the kids are preteens and teens doesn’t work like it does when kids are young, especially if Mom or Dad are still fully involved. Parental relationships don’t develop as naturally, if at all. A “fun aunt” or friendly type relation tends to happen in healthy households instead. 

There’s just a lot of information missing from this post. What kind of relationship does your wife have with your daughters? Is she close with them? Has she made overtures? Have they indicated at any time they see her as a mother? Has there been serious tension or bad experiences? Has she been given a motherly role in your daughter’s life? Do you and your ex allow your wife to actually parent? Is she involved in decision making as equally? Would your daughter have wanted to spend Mother’s Day with your wife if her biological mother was available? Has your daughter ever even acknowledged your wife on Mothers day before? 

Depending on the answer to any of those questions, your wife could be being perfectly reasonable or a total asshole. Either way, it’s not particularly fair for you to expect her to “fill-in” because biomom is busy doing something else.",1

5/10 range. Maybe worse. Maybe better. Idk.

Some liked most of it, but are slightly frustrated. Just doesn't ruin it as much for them. 

Some people are really frustrated because they feel 90% of it was dam good, and they set things up nicely in many areas just to bitch out. That's me.

I mean I enjoyed a ton of it. I'm still pissed af. 

And the some just say the whole thing fucking sucked. Every little part. Which is ridiculous. And they're usually the ones saying everything GOT sucks balls and absolutely nothing has been good since 4 and the books will fix everything.

It's not even close to that black and white. 
I think seasons 1-6 will hold up nicely. We don't need to be told that 1-4 are the best consistency wise, even if 2 was slightly weak imo, as we already know. That doesn't make 5-6 absolutely horseshit and the mean it ruined the show.

7 was rushed and absolute ass.  Only season that took me out of the show.

"I think the merge was good. OCE is looking better every season and TR/VN are the best non major regions. ISG looked competitive on every game except for the PVB one.

It's just possible that the 4 best teams are on the same group.

Edit: Also ISG is not that good on Bo1. AK, INF and even R7 are better.",0

Maduro is a shitty leader but as Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Iraq have proved of the last two decades a shitty leader is better than a failed state and a civil war.

"Agreed, in both Infinity War and Endgame, Earth was ground zero for conflicts that would decide the fate of the universe :/ Her presence in the Battle of Wakanda would've prevented the need to even have to check on other planets losing 50% of their population, and who's to say what would've happened if she took her sweet time arriving on Earth while Thanos' warship was pummeling the Avengers? There's no ""other planets"" to protect if Thanos manages to snap away the entire universe out of existence.  
  
Cpt. Marvel being left out of the story to give the OG Avengers time to shine is all good, but there definitely could've been better ways to have her not take away the spotlight without coming off as being ""I'm too good to bother with one planet (not to mention the planet she originally came from)"". Nothing that can't be rectified with some content, like maybe a future movie/novel/comic detailing what kept her occupied enough to keep her eyes away from the crux of the Infinity stone conflict, but as it stands right now she certainly did not make very good decisions if her priority was saving as many planets as she could, given Earth's propensity for being the center of Universe ending conflicts in the MCU.",1

"Homosexuals had to come a long way, for years being openly homosexual meant a life of poverty. Especially if you were male. It was through their hard work and integrity that got them to rise above.

True Indians and other Asians are immigrating here with a positive mindset, but they had to struggle through poverty as well. Hence the many businesses that we use to jokingly call Asian (dry cleaning, nail care) was just them trying to get their foot in the door, trusting that if they get their kids educated and focus them on success, they’ll live a happy life in the west. Because it can be overcome.

To me nobody is inherently criminal and poor in the west. What we are is responsible for our own choices, and we either accept that or we don’t. People that don’t fail, people that do succeed. I don’t think American society overall promotes people to be irresponsible, I think groups of people develop their pocket cultures and their pocket cultures promotes them to be irresponsible. And personally, I think those pocket cultures that promote irresponsible behavior are finally starting to erode. I think videos like this really point out that mindset and I’m sure now that guys family knows how they sound by now. Maybe it’s pride that keeps them from admitting it? At a guess anyhow.",1

"Once again, I ask how I'm ignorant?  No major religion, including Orthodox Judaism, is against vaccination. In fact, most take the stance that vaccinations are a moral imperative in order to protect not just one's children, but also other people who can't be vaccinated.

That means there has to be more going on here beyond the faith angle (other than the fact this community is tight-knit and spend a lot of time together, thereby increasing chances for disease transmission).  If you spend any time intercting with antivaxers on social media, you will see a very common link: they espouse bodily purity, ""clean"" eating and anything ""natural"": organic food, essential oils, chiropractic and homeopathy, that sort of thing.  All of that is out of reach for many low income households, as is traveling overseas (linked to the current NY outbreak) and going to theme parks (2015 Disneyland outbreak).

In the end, it is extremely privileged and selfish to refuse to take on the responsibility (and minimal risk) of vaccinating one's children while relying on herd immunity to do the job.  It is privileged for parents to deny their children the protection they more than likely themselves received as children.  It is privileged to bask in the luxury of vaccine refusal while parents in developing countries are desperate to vaccinate their children.",1

"It’s true. Businesses have pervaded the election process. 

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0

"Illegitimate as in lacking legitimacy. The issue they claim they are investigating was previously investigated four time and found not to be true.

The book by Luke Rosiak went into greater detail and found out just how large And dangerous the IT breach was, and the extent of the Democrat house leaderships attempts to bury or obstruct an investigation. Trump made passing reference to it as something more worthy of investigation than his campaign and apparently he was correct. 

And do I think that Democrats want laws enforced? Lol. No, I don’t think democrats are supportive of laws.

"I think there's a delicate balance that needs to be maintained between logical character choices and what makes good TV. I think if Arya just silently snuck up behind him and stabbed him in the back, that likely would have also been perceived as anticlimactic. The jump out of the darkness really gives the moment excitement and is amazing to watch in slow motion. Plus, I'm convinced Arya needed to stab the NK in the heart through the front of his chest in the same manner he was created in order for him to die, so the writers essentially needed her to do something that would make him turn around, hence the yell. I think you could probably argue that a guttural yell of rage may have actually been quite natural / involuntary in that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The same could be said for the complaints regarding the strategies used during the battle. Yes, in real life, maybe the wights and WWs could have easily just surrounded Winterfell and starved everyone out. Maybe they could have sent another WW henchman to fetch Bran and bring him to the NK. Maybe Dany could have slowly and methodically burned up bunches of wights while Jon guarded Bran. But all of this would have been pretty boring to watch.",1

That way you can get rid of that fuckin pencil neck and  slumped ass, weak ass posture you carry yourself with. Get rid of the fucking cat. Cats aren't worth having. The money you spend on it and the time it takes to (I assume) clean your sheets all the goddamn time will be better spent elsewhere. Quit being such a self loathing fuck and you may earn a few friends. Maybe one with enough motivation that you can borrow some to do literally anything but sit on your fat ass. But otherwise you will just have to quit being such a little pussy if you want to accomplish anything. When you get your driver's license next year you can offer to take girls on fun dates and then maybe get some pussy. Better chances if you've fixed that 40 year old dad haircut by then.

Well, he has no problems expressing his resentment and hatred and lust. He's just a total jerk. And why would a woman put up with a man who kept saying stupid sh*t to the ""love of his life""?

"Not trying to argue or say you are wrong by any means (in fact, consensus opinion would seem to dictate that *I* am the one wrong), but this is why I don't understand. Here would be my breakdown of the same points.

Plot: Nothing special. Truly, it's a standard point A to point B plot, with a fresh coat of dusty, Australian paint. 

Soundtrack: Awesome, I agree.

Sound mixing: Eh, I mean I have no complaints and I guess that's all you can ask for. ""Incredible"" though implies it should stand out, which it never did to me.

Direction: With a plot this simple, I really cannot see many directors *not* ""delivering what it set out to do."" Not saying he did not do a good job, or that his own personal style did not heavily influence the film, but again I don't understand why so many people treat the direction here as godlike.

Cast: Hardy could have been any actor and it would have made no difference. I have no complaints over him, but Max as a character is hardly a difficult role. Charlize, great, I agree. Supporting cast, great, I agree.

Design: Great, I agree. Exceptional worldbuilding!

Editing: The movie made sense and flowed well. Again, with a plot this simple, I do not see this as a particularly marvelous accomplishment.

Again, these are just my opinions! I am not saying they're right or better than the general consensus. This is just my point of view on it. My biggest gripe is probably the plot, which the average person seemed to think was incredible, whereas I thought it was *at the absolute best,* serviceable. When measured up against other action movies, it does not stand out in the least. The strongest element was the worldbuilding to me, by a mile. Remarkable job on that aspect. :)",1

Then, the Chiefs will be in the same situation they are in with Hunt right now. Their reward for cutting a player that did something wrong will be getting to play them in January.",0

Now that home consoles and PCs have great graphics the arcade industry realized they have to give an experience instead of just a game. 

Plus they will also have games people used to like to play against each other in the arcade like MvC and the new Streetfighter, and of course ticket games.

Dogs and cats aren't the only animals that can feel this precious thing called love. And they feel pain as much as you and me. Who likes to feel pain? Who likes being sad? We steal their babies from them as soon as they're born so we can suck all of their milk for us. It makes mother cows bellow and cry for days.

But that doesn’t mean a white rich girl who’s had every privilege in life can suddenly become the voice of a fight that isn’t hers to begin with. Specially someone as unlikeable as Brie Larson. And especially when we’ve had lots of other (way better) female role models through the years.

If it’s all about scoring minority points, ScarJo has more points than her, tbqh.",1
"I think that’s the new trio, however I’ve heard that a lot of actors don’t like Larson because she’s a narcissist. Supposedly Renner wants to work with her as little as possible. I really hope all of that isn’t true because CM was a pretty good movie (for a regular movie it was great but for a MCU movie it wasn’t the best) &amp; her story line is supposed to be really good. Also a bit sad that she didn’t have that big of a role in Endgame but I understand if that was a true sendoff for all three.",0

"Just got back from a business trip to Washington DC. Used the scooters both while drunk/barhopping and sober/sightseeing. They are an extremely cheap and fun mode of transportation. That being said, as I was scooting my way from the Smithsonian to the Lincoln Memorial, I noticed that there are no bike lanes to be used, so pedestrians and scooter riders share the same walking path. I ended up dumping the scooter and walking from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial, as the heavy foot traffic was causing me to slow down frequently to pass around groups of people. The other alternative is riding like a complete asshole, and yelling ""ON YOUR LEFT!"" as you narrowly wedge your way past a group of people.

"Well you're correct there's a WORLD of difference, there's a WORLD of similarity in the fact that they're both non-hockey plays and the two have a sizable history. The difference being one was in the play with heavier force, the other was outside of the play, [more]blind sided than the other, and the whistle had already gone. 

Had Marchand connected with the base of the neck/head/whatever, serious inujury could have occured.

One player was penalized concurrent to the potential damage done. The other was not penalized because no serious damage was done.

It's a disparity in officiating. This was reviewed post play and deemed okay. It's a blatant non-hockey play, and a lot different from jabbing someone in the face from the front. And with Marchand's track list, there should have been some sort of disciplinary action in order to dissuade it from happening in the future.",0

"They claim to not believe in a creator god but they bow before idols of the buddha. It's like how christianity prohibits idolatory but every church has idols of jesus and mary. 

Buddhists worship relics like this tree and a tooth. Christians worship the shroud and other relics and Muslims worship the prophet's hair so I guess its par for the course among religions.

Also Buddhists believe the buddha came up with the laws of thermodynamics before newton. karma vipaka (cause and effect) is like newtons law about every action having an equal and opposite reaction except without all the math underpinning it.",0

The troll never even enters the room, Frodo stabs it in the foot and it fucks off and is never seen again. There's a sentence that basically sums up the entire battle, something like ""Aragorn and Boromir slew many."" Don't describe it or anything, don't tell us about their epic deeds... nah, they 'slew many' and that's it.

The refs are supposed to be the arbitrary arm of NBA play. If they fire a ref because popular players like him then the sets a terrible precedent.

"I think there's a delicate balance that needs to be maintained between logical character choices and what makes good TV. I think if Arya just silently snuck up behind him and stabbed him in the back, that likely would have also been perceived as anticlimactic. The jump out of the darkness really gives the moment excitement and is amazing to watch in slow motion. Plus, I'm convinced Arya needed to stab the NK in the heart through the front of his chest in the same manner he was created in order for him to die, so the writers essentially needed her to do something that would make him turn around, hence the yell. I think you could probably argue that a guttural yell of rage may have actually been quite natural / involuntary in that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The same could be said for the complaints regarding the strategies used during the battle. Yes, in real life, maybe the wights and WWs could have easily just surrounded Winterfell and starved everyone out. Maybe they could have sent another WW henchman to fetch Bran and bring him to the NK. Maybe Dany could have slowly and methodically burned up bunches of wights while Jon guarded Bran.

"As an ex DB employee (on the IB side) if there was one thing DB did well (since we sucked at everything else), starting in 2015 was Know Your Client protocols (“KYC”). Regardless of branch of the bank, all KYC protocols were sent to the same central department for approval. It would sometimes take us weeks to collect all the detailed information needed before doing business with any client. Before any client could be adopted, all UBO (ultimate beneficial owner) information all the way to the top owner/investor was collected (even on legacy clients as they overhauled the prior system due to being highly scrutinized and also fined for prior flawed policy on KYC protocol). Information needed for client adoptions included details of every shell company that led up to the UBO. In layman’s terms, the path cash would take from the outward/consumer facing company, through all the shells, all the way to the end guy who is an investor / owner. Any owner that owned more than I believe it was 10% was subject to this. To satisfy KYC, detailed tax information would definitely be collected on both the individual and each shell company. The irony of this is this protocol is in place to ensure the end user wasn’t money laundering, a terrorist or from a sanctioned nation (like Iran or Russia at that time) etc. Anyone that understands the documentation that was likely collected to satisfy KYC protocol understands this could be an absolute gold mine of information. Just some food for thought. 

Edit: Do I expect DB to comply and do the right thing? Short answer is no because if there is anything fishy going on it could also incriminate the bank",0

"Has society really become so debased in recent times that we signal our respect to others by typing ""F""? How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - ""Call of Duty"", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and ""pressing F"". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice.

"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically. 

Peoples misconception of the arcs and mixing that with theories they’ve heard and prophecies they’ve taken either literally or misinterpreted is the problem here more than bad writing",1

Quick! Learn 30 one line jokes!,1
"First, this article is bunk because no matter whether a president can or can't be indicted, Mueller was never going to stray from DOJ policy.

Second, a sitting president can't be indicted. The executive branch is in charge of carrying out and enforcing the laws Congress creates. if a president committed a crime, ultimately it would fall to that very same president, as the highest level of authority of the executive branch, to decide whether or not to indict and prosecute that case. 

Seems like most presidents would just excuse their own crimes since they'd have that self autonomy.

Which is why they have the check of the House being able to impeach a charge and the Senate then convicting, with subsequent removal from office.

I'm pretty sure that our original government framers were capable of seeing the ridiculousness of what would be the president prosecuting himself essentially.

What they definitely didn't see becoming a reality is Congress becoming a corporately sponsored hyper partisan body that over the years regularly grinds to a halt on a regular basis due to disagreements across party lines.",1
"I'm going to hate myself for writing this but you're in trump land now. They're taking a book out of our bastard, non-vote-winning, pussy-necked president that if someone says, does, or exists in a way you don't like, you sue them to shield yourself and drag things out.",1

"I really hope the details in this letter are true. Obviously it's a letter written by a lawyer, so everything is going to be made to sound like absolutely nothing is going on. But I really want it to be true, because then it would mean maybe they aren't such terrible parents. And a kid doesn't have to go through the trauma of losing their parents. 

Reddit and social media do love to blow things up and make assumptions. Not that they don't have some justification for assuming someone who attacked their pregnant girlfriend is a piece of shit. But outside that one incident in college every report I've ever heard of anyone interacting with Hill both as teammates and strangers/fans has been very positive. He doesn't typically exude that assholish POS behavior you see from guys like Greg Hardy, or even Frank Clark who has had a couple incidents. 

This whole thing just depresses me, and I just wish I knew the whole truth.",1

"That really soured the whole experience for me, in a big way. I know I should be able to just brush it off, but it just felt so *icky* and blatant. Plus, right after that to have Cap Marvel hand wrestle Thanos as a callback to Rogers, but her doing it better than the man could... Yech.

I love a lot of the heroines, and they're strong enough characters on their own that Disney doesn't need to shove their female identity in our faces. In fact, I'd make the argument those two moments reduce those characters to their status as women, to political tools for female empowerment, rather than letting them hold their own as just equal characters. It's counterintuitive to the whole point of gender equality in the first place.",1

"With the huge lineup of characters I agree some have to step down as just a cameo but to be the one that saves Tony and save the team from the ship firing down on them I’d say her role in the film is a little more than a cameo. 

Also Spider-Man may not have any flaws in endgame because I would say he is 100% a cameo and returning motivation for Tony as well as a fan pleasure. But in homecoming and I guess civil war his flaw is that he is yet to understand responsibility (insert uncle Ben joke here) but his innocence and cockiness is shown throughout the film.",1

"&gt; There are a lot of misconceptions about these women that are holding them back. People think they've slept with 1000's of men, that they likely have diseases, that they are criminals, that they are probably drug addicts who have become somewhat violent and dangerous as a survival mechanism and have lost touch with the moral norms of society... These are all true,

I married a woman who lied about her history and what she had been up to for most of her life. Believe me, she hid it quite well. There were clues I missed because I lacked context and experience but just the same, from time to time in the year and a half I knew her before getting married she occasionally let slip comments that a more knowledgeable person would have or could have picked up on. Tracing back to through her history and occasional comments, hiring a PI to follow her around when I wasn't home and literally catching her in the act, I had to face the fact she had been a prostitute and still was an active prostitute. She secretly continued using drugs which I found out when I had to call an ambulance after an overdose and her son retrieved the barbiturate container which we showed EMS so they could treat her effectively, and then she blamed me for causing her to use drugs. She would become violent for no particular reason, she was a chronic and skilled liar, she defrauded the immigration system to get here and in the end was hit with an annulment based on fraud and deported with her son. She did lose touch with any form of ethics and social norms. It's not that she didn't know what right and wrong was, she just didn't care. To her, she didn't mind doing anything so long as she wasn't caught. When caught, she declared I was stupid with all my ethics, like, not lying and stealing from family, friends and your spouse. Oh, and not seeing the benefits of prostitution and getting into her ""business"". Even the judge slammed her on these issues. Oh, she talked so sweet and sounded so nice, like the sweet little victim as her attorney fell for her sweet talk and defended her enthusiastically. On the last day of hearings when we brought out all the documents that showed she was lying to everyone including the federal government her own attorney finally realized how badly he'd been misled. He actually believed her. I even felt a bit of pity for him when in utter disgust he threw his carefully thought out notes on the table in disgust. As for her, I felt no pity when I saw the look of shock on her face as the judge granted me annulment based on fraud and slammed his gavel down. Everything she had worked and schemed for destroyed in that moment. I didn't even feel bad when I learned she had been deported. She had her chance and blew it. You can take the whore off the streets but you can't make a whore into a wife or a respectable citizen. The only misconception  here is thinking there are misconceptions. No, society has this right.",1
"Agreed, in both Infinity War and Endgame, Earth was ground zero for conflicts that would decide the fate of the universe :/ Her presence in the Battle of Wakanda would've prevented the need to even have to check on other planets losing 50% of their population, and who's to say what would've happened if she took her sweet time arriving on Earth while Thanos' warship was pummeling the Avengers? There's no ""other planets"" to protect if Thanos manages to snap away the entire universe out of existence.  
  
Cpt. Marvel being left out of the story to give the OG Avengers time to shine is all good, but there definitely could've been better ways to have her not take away the spotlight without coming off as being ""I'm too good to bother with one planet (not to mention the planet she originally came from)"". Nothing that can't be rectified with some content, like maybe a future movie/novel/comic detailing what kept her occupied enough to keep her eyes away from the crux of the Infinity stone conflict, but as it stands right now she certainly did not make very good decisions if her priority was saving as many planets as she could, given Earth's propensity for being the center of Universe ending conflicts in the MCU.",1

"First, this article is bunk because no matter whether a president can or can't be indicted, Mueller was never going to stray from DOJ policy.

Second, a sitting president can't be indicted. The executive branch is in charge of carrying out and enforcing the laws Congress creates. if a president committed a crime, ultimately it would fall to that very same president, as the highest level of authority of the executive branch, to decide whether or not to indict and prosecute that case. 

Seems like most presidents would just excuse their own crimes since they'd have that self autonomy.

Which is why they have the check of the House being able to impeach a charge and the Senate then convicting, with subsequent removal from office.

I'm pretty sure that our original government framers were capable of seeing the ridiculousness of what would be the president prosecuting himself essentially.

What they definitely didn't see becoming a reality is Congress becoming a corporately sponsored hyper partisan body that over the years regularly grinds to a halt on a regular basis due to disagreements across party lines.",1

The previous tuning was definitely skewed more towards fast match times than it needed to be, so we re-tuned.

I love a lot of the heroines, and they're strong enough characters on their own that Disney doesn't need to shove their female identity in our faces.

"It's always been ""just another TV show"" it's just that GRRM is a master at misdirection. He makes you think Ned is the guy that's gonna solve it all and get to the root of the problem with the corrupt throne. Then it's Robb and Cat, with some aid from Renly. Then it's Stannis. But all of these were masterfully crafted red herrings. None of those characters were ever the ""main characters"" you just *thought* they were. The protagonists have always been Jon, Arya, Sansa, Theon to an extent, Dany, Bran (but I've got theories that he's not just a wholesome greenseer) If you look back at all of she sticky situations the actual main characters were in over the years, you can see that they were *never in real danger*. Why would Arya die a blind panhandler in bravos? Why would Sansa get tortured to death by ramsay Bolton? Ask yourself, ""for what purpose would this character die?"" and in every situation our main heroes were in over the years, them dying at that time made zero fucking sense. *There has always been plot armor*. Fucking Valyrian steel, dragonglass studded plate armor on every God damn one of our protagonists.

Now, I understand the gripes people have with the unrealistic situations Sam was in in ep3, Grey worm to a certain extent, yeah I guess Lyannas death was a bit cheesy on my 3rd re-watch but when it was live, I fucking loved it. I get that having *only* redshirt die in the crypts was a bit unbelievable. I wouldn't of minded maybe 2 more minor characters die who's arcs were complete like Grey worm and missandei. But for the rest of the cast? It just doesn't make sense for them to die in a hopeless slaughter. There's 4 hours of show left. Plenty of loose ends to tie up and more than enough time to do so.",1

"I’m almost certain the 12 year old girl wasn’t buying a dildo but rather a clitoral vibrator. Young girls typically use small clitoral vibrators and I’m certain that’s what this girl’s mom agreed to buy her... these vibrators also have no resemblance of a penis either... so is that okay then? 

Additional, it seems you’re under the assumption that all women/young girls can orgasm with just their hands, which is absolutely untrue. Nearly 50% of women need a vibrator to orgasm during masturbation and 5% of women will never orgasm once in their lifetime. So you’re theory that a girl using a vibrator means she’s advancing to something more serious than strictly manual masturbation is flawed, because for a lot of women, including myself, the first time they ever masturbating is with a clitoral vibrator due to their inability to orgasm or even come close to orgasm without it. 

Your last comment is confusing... are you saying it’s okay for a 12 year old to have a vibrator or pocket pussy as long as they sneak around their parents back? It seems you’re making the argument that the reason it was wrong for you to have one at 12 was because it would have made your dad uncomfortable, not because there’s anything wrong with having one?",1

"I felt bad for you at first but then you literally shred her culture into pieces. 

Dowry in Chinese culture is not a law but tradition.  Husbands also often help out with wife's family.  You may not want to follow that, which is completely fine, but it sound like you don't actually know the Chinese family cultures and traditions. 

There is no fucking law against dowry in Canada. It is not illegal, just not recognized by law all the time in the specific cultural senses (which depends on the culture) but there has been court ruling to include a dowry.

In Chinese culture, dowry is made to the bride's family by the husband, not the other way round. And if a couple split, wife can still be rewarded a split of networth of the husband, or the other way round, for that matter.

I had property before I married but I recognize that once I get married, my husband can get a share of my networth/property. I love him and am happy to share ny life and everything in it with him. There is nothing wrong with having a pre-nup, but I wonder what tone of voice you used when discussing the topic.

"Has society really become so debased in recent times that we signal our respect to others by typing ""F""? How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - ""Call of Duty"", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and ""pressing F"". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice.

"I’m almost certain the 12 year old girl wasn’t buying a dildo but rather a clitoral vibrator. Young girls typically use small clitoral vibrators and I’m certain that’s what this girl’s mom agreed to buy her... these vibrators also have no resemblance of a penis either... so is that okay then? 

Additional, it seems you’re under the assumption that all women/young girls can orgasm with just their hands, which is absolutely untrue. Nearly 50% of women need a vibrator to orgasm during masturbation and 5% of women will never orgasm once in their lifetime. So you’re theory that a girl using a vibrator means she’s advancing to something more serious than strictly manual masturbation is flawed, because for a lot of women, including myself, the first time they ever masturbating is with a clitoral vibrator due to their inability to orgasm or even come close to orgasm without it. 

Your last comment is confusing... are you saying it’s okay for a 12 year old to have a vibrator or pocket pussy as long as they sneak around their parents back? It seems you’re making the argument that the reason it was wrong for you to have one at 12 was because it would have made your dad uncomfortable, not because there’s anything wrong with having one?",1

"I wasn’t saying that dragons in and of themselves existing is the unbelievable thing. Dragons should not exist because they’d collapse under their own weight. It has nothing to do with magic, that’s just science and logic. Same thing with a skeleton hand punching through solid rock. It’s all the same rules of reality that govern gravity, survivability in combat, and the relatively sharpness of weaponry. If those things are okay, then so should someone managing to disentangle themselves from a swarm with the use of their one-shot zombie lightsabers and the aid of close-by allies. Otherwise, you’re utilizing *selective suspension,* where something’s that break reality and logic and somethings aren’t just because you wanted to see some more dead main characters. 

That’s my thing. The more I hear people saying it’s a matter of believability and physics and whatever, the more it just doesn’t add up because if you actually cared about these characters and their struggles and stories and lives, then the fact they did survive despite these insurmountable odds should be joyous. Instead it seems like it matters more that fucking Isaac Newton’s math homework should be respected and just *bitch, bitch, bitch.* If you like these people and this story, then why it is such a big deal? Why the endless debates? Especially when there’s not been a precedent for major characters dying in battle, and statistically speaking, that’s when a main character is the safest. Name me a main character or major supporting character who has died in the thick of battle like everyone seemed to expect this episode. There was Ygritte. That’s the only one who comes to my mind.

I understand it’s an issue, maybe they should have shot those scenes to be less dogpile-y or Arya’s leap should be shorter or whatever else, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad writing or a bad story. It’s bad math and bad physics, but math and physics and even *logic herself* are not the rulers of Story-Town. They can advise on some things, but they do not make the final call. Even in Game of Thrones, they’ve never made the final call. And if that’s your primary concern when it comes to stories, then maybe you need to re-examine your priories.",1

"&gt;Statistically more people having guns is going to mean more gun accidents

Yes. I said that, and I think I may have reiterated it too, I completely agree. Also sounds like that guy wasn't a very *responsible* gun owner lol

Addressing your second paragraph I'm sorry, but I have no reason to believe that even though you seem like an honest person. Plus you just said you don't take anecdotes as evidence. Not calling you a liar I'd just prefer to disregard that. And seems like the parents weren't very *responsible gun owners*.

&gt;But to your point about opening up access to guns in more places, I think that is pretty unrealistic as a method of stopping rampage shooters frankly

What's so unrealistic? I agree it would be damn near impossible to convince people, but I don't see how it could fail.

&gt;The primary determinant in any sort of firefight is not who is a better shot, it is who shoots first, who has the element of surprise, and who dictates where the firefight takes place

No offense, but I'm not going to take an internet strangers tactical advice lol, but yeah whoever shoots first has an advantage over the people in that room, but once anyone who is armed is alerted and ready which will happen directly after the first shots ring out, the playing field is even. And if there is more than one armed person that gives the defenders an advantage.

&gt; Take the Vegas shooter. I am willing to bet there were people who were armed in the area besides law enforcement, but they were completely unable to stop a man who was able to make some small preparations

Funny thing about that, turns out the festival was actually a gun free zone, shocker I know.

&gt;And most of the scenarios we are discussing still end after only a few people become victims anyways, in which case it is difficult to see how having a even an improbably high concentration of gun carrying people around could significantly alter things before cops show up

There's just so many fucking variables man, I mean how many people are armed, how many seconds do they have to respond, are they in the same room, but one thing is certain if somebody is armed, and capable of taking out the shooter, minimizing the time they have to kill there will be less victims. Doesn't matter if they take them out before they fire a shot, or if the shooter has already unfortunately had enough time to cause damage.

&gt;where only one or two people are armed like teachers in a school, all that means is that teachers will become the first targets, and then things will proceed as usual.

No. Not if they shoot the shooter first. It's impossible to predict who will prevail, but would you really rather just let people die than have a fighting chance? I'm going to use a hypothetical here. Say you're an armed teacher during a shooting. The shooting is about to come through your door, you would have the first visual on them meaning you have the jump on them and can shoot. If you weren't armed in this situation everyone dies. If you are maybe everyone dies, but more likely you shoot the bad boi first.

&gt;People have to take risks in life, and being on guard all the time is just not possible.

You don't have to be on guard all the time, you just have to hear the shots, recognize the situation, and shoot back.

&gt;And when it comes to the black market, yes it is an option for acquiring weapons, but only for criminals with criminal connections which is not most people

It is shockingly easy to get a gun illegally, I'd say that cracking down on illegal weapons would be the biggest life saver. For the rest I agree the screening process should include a mental health evaluation although it's debatable weather or not that would be at all effective, because people can you know, lie. I'm going to assume you've never bought a gun before because if you had you would know the screening process is very thorough, and there is already lots of restrictions on who can, and can't buy guns.

&gt;The idea that every criminal is running around with an AKM much less an M60 is a fantasy borne out of movies and television.

I agree. And I think the demonization of certain guns, like the AR-15 is stupid, and proves how little the people trying to ban guns know about guns. They say dumb shit like ""fully semi-automatic"" and how powerful it is, when
.223 is a fairly weak round. The reality is very little gun crime and even shootings are committed with rifles and a staggering amount is with pistols, and the only reason the AR is used is because how easy it is to operate. Not to mention the fact that when you ban AR's a new gun will be adopted that is equal to it. Banning AR's is for the soul purpose that they look scary, if you show someone a wooden gun with the same magazine capacity, that shoots the same round, but is made of wood they won't give a shit because it's not black and tacticool.

"&gt;Why the hell you sending cavalry in by itself

Dothraki are a field army. As Robert said ""[only a fool would fight the Dothraki on an open field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OitYP2MTYMg)""

Also relevant cavalry charge from Lord of the rings

Only reason people are complaining is because it was unsuccessful

&gt;having the riders carve the flanks to bits like a common fucking battle tactic.

There is no position advantage when fighting wights. Rear, front, sides its all the same.

&gt;Staying inside the keep and making it a battle of attrition you can win?

Battle of attrition against an undead army.  That doesn't eat, sleep, get tired, have emotion and can create another army of undead on the spot. Attrition is not something living people can do against the undead

I mean come on they instantly lost the walls, and even with the cavalry charge, two dragons clearing the open field, defense of the wall and courtyard the wights still made it to theon

&gt;Why not use the dragons to carve a path for the dothraki to charge into?

Clear a path to what exactly? A commander thats nowhere to be seen? Only thing you are doing is allowing whatever forces you cleared a path for to be more easily surrounded",1

"I think there's a delicate balance that needs to be maintained between logical character choices and what makes good TV. I think if Arya just silently snuck up behind him and stabbed him in the back, that likely would have also been perceived as anticlimactic. The jump out of the darkness really gives the moment excitement and is amazing to watch in slow motion. Plus, I'm convinced Arya needed to stab the NK in the heart through the front of his chest in the same manner he was created in order for him to die, so the writers essentially needed her to do something that would make him turn around, hence the yell. I think you could probably argue that a guttural yell of rage may have actually been quite natural / involuntary in that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The same could be said for the complaints regarding the strategies used during the battle. Yes, in real life, maybe the wights and WWs could have easily just surrounded Winterfell and starved everyone out. Maybe they could have sent another WW henchman to fetch Bran and bring him to the NK. Maybe Dany could have slowly and methodically burned up bunches of wights while Jon guarded Bran. But all of this would have been pretty boring to watch.",1

"&gt; There are a lot of misconceptions about these women that are holding them back. People think they've slept with 1000's of men, that they likely have diseases, that they are criminals, that they are probably drug addicts who have become somewhat violent and dangerous as a survival mechanism and have lost touch with the moral norms of society... These are all true,

I married a woman who lied about her history and what she had been up to for most of her life. Believe me, she hid it quite well. There were clues I missed because I lacked context and experience but just the same, from time to time in the year and a half I knew her before getting married she occasionally let slip comments that a more knowledgeable person would have or could have picked up on. Tracing back to through her history and occasional comments, hiring a PI to follow her around when I wasn't home and literally catching her in the act, I had to face the fact she had been a prostitute and still was an active prostitute. She secretly continued using drugs which I found out when I had to call an ambulance after an overdose and her son retrieved the barbiturate container which we showed EMS so they could treat her effectively, and then she blamed me for causing her to use drugs. She would become violent for no particular reason, she was a chronic and skilled liar, she defrauded the immigration system to get here and in the end was hit with an annulment based on fraud and deported with her son. She did lose touch with any form of ethics and social norms. It's not that she didn't know what right and wrong was, she just didn't care. To her, she didn't mind doing anything so long as she wasn't caught. When caught, she declared I was stupid with all my ethics, like, not lying and stealing from family, friends and your spouse. Oh, and not seeing the benefits of prostitution and getting into her ""business"". Even the judge slammed her on these issues. Oh, she talked so sweet and sounded so nice, like the sweet little victim as her attorney fell for her sweet talk and defended her enthusiastically. On the last day of hearings when we brought out all the documents that showed she was lying to everyone including the federal government her own attorney finally realized how badly he'd been misled. He actually believed her. I even felt a bit of pity for him when in utter disgust he threw his carefully thought out notes on the table in disgust. As for her, I felt no pity when I saw the look of shock on her face as the judge granted me annulment based on fraud and slammed his gavel down. Everything she had worked and schemed for destroyed in that moment. I didn't even feel bad when I learned she had been deported. She had her chance and blew it. You can take the whore off the streets but you can't make a whore into a wife or a respectable citizen. The only misconception  here is thinking there are misconceptions. No, society has this right.",1

but I digress

retail is absolutely physically exploitative. good friend of mine needed a full knee replacement as a teenager bc the stepladder broke underneath them while retrieving 50 pound bags of cat litter from the top shelf (those bags aren't stackable so management liked to have them up top). management didn't pay a cent cause they had provided a too-short stepladder, forcing them to use that top step that's ""not a step."" that way, when it DID break, they could say the worker knowingly did something unsafe &amp; is responsible. she continued to work there &amp; in fact works there to this day bc she got kicked out for being gay, so no choice. she interviewed other places but the management of her current job told them all she sued them for workman's comp so none of them would hire her. oh, and her pay got docked. she picked up another 2 very similar, very low-paying jobs to make up for it.

another friend from further back, somewhere around 12, was working under the table for an uncle who wanted her at the shop doors at 4am so she could get things ready for him to open before she went to school every day &amp; then close for him every night. she took drugs to counter the sleep deprivation &amp; walked to the store alone, in the dark. her parents were abusive &amp; made her pay rent, so she couldn't quit.

We've done these measurements.

Socioeconomic status does indeed make a difference. But the difference caused by SES is less than the racial achievement gap.

For instance, on the SATs (standardized US college entrance exams), [the poorest whites outscore the *richest* blacks on average.](http://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html)

The richest black students had an average SAT score 139 points below that of white students of the same income level, and 10 points lower than that of whites of the *lowest* income level (people who were more than *ten times* poorer than they were). This is on a test where the average score is about 1000.

Pretending like these gaps don't exist doesn't make them go away. It doesn't help black people in any way. It doesn't solve the problem.

""...and you didn’t expect Kings Canyon to stay the same forever, did you?"" For EA play in June. So yeah, they've mentioned it.

Fortnite had like 13 named locations to land compared to Apex's current 17 plus Supply Ship. Tilted Towers was the first big map update outside of some small buildings, and that was 3.5 months in from official release -  not counting the time Fortnite BR was considered a LTM for StW. Fortnite Season 1 was long over before Tilted was patched in. As you say, Apex Legends is almost 3 months into it's lifetime and still in S1. The map is fine.

While we're at it, lets keep going for some perspective. Fortnite had a weapon they could not balance at release, so they just removed it. Their other guns' values/stats had to be adjusted by amounts of up *50 freaking %*.  Server problems they were having at launch lasted well into Season 2 (And if we're honest, beyond). Fortnite did not track stats at launch. Fortnite did not have Voice chat. Outside of a HoT item and iconic Bush, Fortnite's additional items in S1 are already in Apex in some form (Launch Pad, Smoke nades). Epic promised something called a Badges/Medals system that I dont think ever came to be. They hinted at gunplay changes that took MONTHS to implement. Finally, Fortnite did NOT have a Battle Pass for S1, having 4 skins instead.

Apex had a few problem guns that have been addressed and AFAIK the changes have been good, but I'd be glad for any concrete info here. Server problems are being looked at. Stats are tracked. Voice Chat has been there since Day 1 (Could be improved but it is there.) Every piece of loot/item has some role to play, maybe we're lacking a HoT for now. Respawn laid a plan out with the roadmap and have stuck to it so far. Apex had an optional Battle Pass for purchase at S1 launch and several other skins for purchase at the store.

Well, that didn’t happen, and Tumblr is still there and nothing really changed for the majority if its users. 

Now Reddit is convinced that Tahm Kench is in the gutter when that’s clearly not the case. None of the people breaking down the changes have any idea how the champion plays out and I highly doubt anyone posting about top lane have a working knowledge of him either. 

But here’s the thing: it doesn’t matter. Actual Kench players are gonna keep playing him and keep doing well. Possibly even better now that Q, E, passive, and base stats changes allow him to lane more aggressively than he could before and also shore up some of his weaker match-ups by making him more durable and providing additional sustain. 

Just ignore all if the nonsense. Reddit doesn’t know Tahm Kench.",0

"She's done basically nothing wrong since she's been back from braavos. 

The psychological trauma she went through hasn't been touched upon outside of her ability to kill without remorse.

Her personality is still very much there. She's quipped and joked around with multiple characters. She's just a bit more serious since her time on braavos. I'm okay with this one.

She didn’t finish the training but she got the drop on Jaquen and bested the waif. They can’t show every little intricate detail of the training that she went through so they just showed the parts that looked good onscreen. She snuck up on Jon in broad daylight which I would say adds a little bit of difficulty. She also wasn’t attempting to assassinate him so I assume she was probably moving at a leisurely pace. The point of them showing causing that white walkers hair to move like that was to show that she was too quick to be noticed which is why they weren’t able to do anything. I think the dragon fire vs valerian steel question is dumb. And I agree that there were issues with the episode,1

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0

Riot is receptive to community feedback, but have shown that they're not really interested in fixing any issues if those issues aren't negatively impacting the game's profits.

If Riot has no reason to believe the community is upset about the state of matchmaking.

"I felt bad for you at first but then you literally shred her culture into pieces. 

Dowry in Chinese culture is not a law but tradition.  Husbands also often help out with wife's family.  You may not want to follow that, which is completely fine, but it sound like you don't actually know the Chinese family cultures and traditions. 

There is no fucking law against dowry in Canada. It is not illegal, just not recognized by law all the time in the specific cultural senses (which depends on the culture) but there has been court ruling to include a dowry.

In Chinese culture, dowry is made to the bride's family by the husband, not the other way round. And if a couple split, wife can still be rewarded a split of networth of the husband, or the other way round, for that matter.

I had property before I married but I recognize that once I get married, my husband can get a share of my networth/property. I love him and am happy to share ny life and everything in it with him.

&gt; COLOMBO - Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said a foreign mastermind may have planned the Easter Sunday bombings, claimed by Islamic State, telling the militant group to &amp;quot;Leave my country alone&amp;quot;.

&gt; Sirisena said authorities were aware of &amp;quot;a small group&amp;quot; of Sri Lankans who had travelled abroad to receive training from Islamic State over the past decade.

&gt; In the video, a bearded man with Baghdadi&amp;#039;s appearance says the Sri Lanka bombings were Islamic State&amp;#039;s response to losses in its last territorial stronghold of Baghouz in Syria.

"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically. 

Peoples misconception of the arcs and mixing that with theories they’ve heard and prophecies they’ve taken either literally or misinterpreted is the problem here more than bad writing",1

"&gt;First, let's recall what that dialog looked like

Ok. The dialogue looked like this:

&gt;""There is no evidence of collusion.""

Simple stuff.

&gt;There was an awful lot of smoke being reported by reputable sources, and there's not a single piece that NYT or WaPo or WSJ reported on the Trump-Rusiia front that Mueller Report disproved.

[You're wrong.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/donald-trump-russia-collusion-cia.html)

[I can do this all day.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/17/yes-there-was-collusion-now-what-will-we-do-about-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d7340256626f)

[There are literally dozens of articles.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/not-true-james-comey-denounces-nyt-report-on-trump-campaign-collusion-with-russia-during-testimony)

(Made sure to use WaPo and NYT articles just for you - there are plenty more, too - just let me know if you need them.)

&gt;So all the stuff that happened that caused us to call for an investigation is shit that *really did happen*.

[You mean a false report that was debunked mid investigation?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

&gt;The softening of the RNC platform, the multiple attempts to establish communication backdoors, the contact between Sessions and Kislayak, and him suibsequently lying about it, a ton of other Trump staffers and Trump himself getting caught lying about contact with Russians - all that was real.

\[Sources please.\]

&gt;What's not real is the characterization that there was ""no collusion"" according to the Mueller report. The accurate characterization is that there wasn't enough admissible evidence to indict for it. Here's what the report has to say on the subject in its opening paragraphs:

That's some hard-core mental gymnastics for a huge nothing burger. Try harder. Your opinion is irrelevant. Meullers isn't. And Meuller said: ""No Evidence of Collusion.""

No matter what you may think constitute evidence... it's irrelevant. Meuller found none and your opinion on the matter is now irrelevant. Thanks for sharing it, though.

&gt;The report proceeds to name Flynn, Papadopolous, Cohen and Manafort as those who got charged.

Are you pretending that these people are guilty of collusion? Because literally none were charged with anything remotely resembling collusion.

&gt;That's not a determination that there was no collusion/coordination/conspiracy. That's ""we investigated the campaign and found enough dirt to indict the campaign manager and his right-hand guy along with Flynn and Papadop. Everyone else covered their tracks well enough that we can't bring a case against them.""

If you investigate a murder and find out that the suspect and his buddies are drug dealers... you arrest them for dealing drugs. But that doesn't mean they're murderers.

In this case: If you investigate collusion and find evidence of Tax Fraud (from years prior and not associated with a ""Russian Collusion"" investigation) you arrest them for their crimes - but that doesn't mean you get to label them as a traitor.

You're trying really hard to make 2+2=5.

&gt;Then of course it's followed by a second half of the report that says ""by the way, here's an open-and-shut case on the president obstructing the everloving shit out of our investigation. Did we mention that's a federal felony? Hey Congress, time for you guys to do your job.""

You must have a gold medal for the Mental Gymnastic Olympics.  Do you know how quotes work? Because that was literally never said. You're paraphrasing with a ridiculous bias. You're painting "" ***The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him***,' as ""he is clearly guilty.""

That is blatantly false. It's about as neutral a statement as one can get (and mine is the actual quote).

Look - it's clear you're chomping at the bit to get Trump with something... but why?

What is your obsession with finding him doing something wrong? What would have to happen for you to rethink your position? What event would need to take place in order for you to take a critical look at the treatment of the President of the United States?",1

"&gt;Eriksen has been poor for months not just for every couple of games imao. 

Eriksen has been overworked and forced to take on his normal attacking responsibilities in addition to covering for the complete lack of midfield, and during that time he's still managed to be the side's chief creative force and the hub of every period of dominance or positive play.

&gt;And Dele has been steadily regressing as a player for years and has had a really poor season too so far. How many goals has he scored this year? 4? 5? How many chances has created for other players? Did you even watch yesterday's game? Both have been very sub par.

Saying Dele's regressed is just nonsense. Last season was his best, most influential for Spurs yet. He's scoring less because he's simply playing a completely different role - he used to play directly off of Kane, he's been gradually moving deeper into a more conventional attacking midfield role and this season sometimes as an outright central midfielder. He started this season excellently, and until he started picking up niggling injuries he was playing some of his best ever football and was arguably the side's strongest performer. And same as Eriksen, the side just looks infinitely better when he's playing. You keep bringing up yesterday... Neither was bad at all, and when Sissoko came on to shore up the midfield their influence started growing and growing.

&gt;And do you know how hard is it to find versatile players like him who can play in 3-4 different positions? Just because he's plays better in the final third it doesn't mean he's a limited player imao. Imagine Eriksen playing as the focal point of attack. Or Dele. Do you think they will do just as a good job as him? They have different roles within the team, sure but that doesn't mean that somehow Dele and Eriksen are more well rounded players than Son.

Dele has played for Spurs in a double pivot, a midfield 3, as a 10, as a second striker, in a front 3... He's aerially strong in both boxes, he offers a passing outlet to the centre backs, he carries the ball from deep... How can you even suggest Son is as well rounded as him? That is nonsense.  Could Son play next to Wanyama like both these guys have done? Could he be the side's playmaker?


&gt;defensively?? That's why he played as a second right back and left back switching sides in the City game???

No? I don't at all. But I never even said Son doesn't contribute defensively, you've conjured that. He's simply not as effective as the other 2, covers less distance, has less physical presence...",1

"I think there's a delicate balance that needs to be maintained between logical character choices and what makes good TV. I think if Arya just silently snuck up behind him and stabbed him in the back, that likely would have also been perceived as anticlimactic. The jump out of the darkness really gives the moment excitement and is amazing to watch in slow motion. Plus, I'm convinced Arya needed to stab the NK in the heart through the front of his chest in the same manner he was created in order for him to die, so the writers essentially needed her to do something that would make him turn around, hence the yell. I think you could probably argue that a guttural yell of rage may have actually been quite natural / involuntary in that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The same could be said for the complaints regarding the strategies used during the battle. Yes, in real life, maybe the wights and WWs could have easily just surrounded Winterfell and starved everyone out. Maybe they could have sent another WW henchman to fetch Bran and bring him to the NK. Maybe Dany could have slowly and methodically burned up bunches of wights while Jon guarded Bran.

Additional, it seems you’re under the assumption that all women/young girls can orgasm with just their hands, which is absolutely untrue. Nearly 50% of women need a vibrator to orgasm during masturbation and 5% of women will never orgasm once in their lifetime. So you’re theory that a girl using a vibrator means she’s advancing to something more serious than strictly manual masturbation is flawed, because for a lot of women, including myself, the first time they ever masturbating is with a clitoral vibrator due to their inability to orgasm or even come close to orgasm without it. 

Your last comment is confusing... are you saying it’s okay for a 12 year old to have a vibrator or pocket pussy as long as they sneak around their parents back? It seems you’re making the argument that the reason it was wrong for you to have one at 12 was because it would have made your dad uncomfortable, not because there’s anything wrong with having one?",1

""A 46,XY mother who developed as a normal woman underwent spontaneous puberty, reached menarche, menstruated regularly, experienced two unassisted pregnancies, and gave birth to a 46,XY daughter with complete gonadal dysgenesis...

Herein we report the extraordinary case of *a fertile woman* with normal ovaries and a *predominantly 46,XY ovarian karyotype*, who gave birth to a 46,XY female with complete gonadal dysgenesis. The karyotype of this phenotypically normal mother was 46,XY in blood, 80% 46,XY and 20% 45,X in cultured skin fibroblasts, and 93% 46,XY, 6% 45,X, and &lt;1% 46,XX in the ovary. The family pedigree on the mother’s side was notable for the presence of seven individuals over four generations with either sexual ambiguity, infertility, or failure to menstruate, including one individual with documented 45,X/45,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Both the mother and the 46,XY daughter were screened for mutations in a number of genes known to be involved in mammalian testis determination. In all genes screened (see below), the open reading frame was found to be normal. This suggests that a mutation in a novel sex-determination gene or a gene that predisposes to chromosomal mosaicism may be responsible for the phenotype in this family...

Maternity testing was performed by using the short tandem repeat kit AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nine short tandem repeats were analyzed (D3S1358, VWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) using thermal cycling conditions, capillary electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and products were analyzed using the ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis instrument and GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems).""

"She should though, if D&amp;D care the slightest bit about bringing character arcs to proper resolution. Cersei was what drove Arya, it's only fitting for Arya's road to finally bring her back to Cersei and finish what was started.

Jaime and Tyrion by comparison have absolutely no will or desire to kill Cersei. You might be able to make a tragic scene out of it, but it seems incredibly easy to make it hamfisted instead given you'd have to make some convoluted situation where Tyrion or Jaime have to kill Cersei.",1

"I remember last election the Bernie Brats spreading Russian misinformation like it was going out of style after they didn’t get their way in the primary.  

Hopefully they’ve grown up, but by the comments lately it doesn’t seem like they have.  

We need unity, but it’s pretty clear it’s going to get ugly.  We’ll be lucky to have a dem candidate that’s not labeled a racist, sexist, or “basically Republican” by the time the primary finishes.  They are already calling people sexist for not saying Warrens the best candidate.",1

"The battle in the mines of Moria is, IIRC, literally a page and a half.

The troll never even enters the room, Frodo stabs it in the foot and it fucks off and is never seen again. There's a sentence that basically sums up the entire battle, something like ""Aragorn and Boromir slew many."" Don't describe it or anything, don't tell us about their epic deeds... nah, they 'slew many' and that's it.

Then they escape by running out of a second exit that was always there and could've been used at any time and Gandalf collapses it behind them.

"&gt;A) correlation does not mean causation; there are many environmental factors that impact educational and intellectual capacities

And? the fact that there is a correlation already justifies the position. Every part of that statement is true. Low IQ parents are more likely to have low IQ children. 

&gt;B) none of these components that you guys claim are demonstrated to be based on genetics, they are environmentally-impacted

 People with low IQ's are more likely to get abortions - Doesn't do be a genetic factor that causes them to get abortions. Point is they are more likely to. 

IQ is strongly correlated with biological parents - This is based on genetics. See Heritability of Intelligence",1

"&gt;She's not my girlfriend formally.
 We've been together for just 3 months. 


1) You're not her dad. You're not her therapist. 

2) You're not remotely prepared to deal with her 5 metric tons of baggage.

3) She needs to be talking to a therapist, not dealing with a relationship where there are two people with reciprocal needs.

4) (and this part is important:) She's not the last woman in the world. Not even close. You can meet someone else whenever you choose. Someone who had 90% less baggage.

5) It's not going to leave a good taste in your mouth, but 3 months of dating semi casually is a pretty good time to say ""this isn't a negotiation. This relationship just isn't going to work. I don't think we're going to work out as a couple."" The less explaining you do, the better. 

6) You're clinging to this relationship because you're afraid of *appearing* like the ""bad guy."" This is called being shallow. 

A deep person recognizes their limits, recognizes that they're not prepared for a situation, and recognizes a relationship that isn't making them happy or getting their needs met. 



&gt;\-She's always worrying about losing me. 

Her insecurities are not your responsibility.

Repeat after me ""This isn't my circus. All these monkeys don't belong to me.""

Stop trying to take responsibility for something that doesn't belong to you, which you cannot control. 

&gt;I don't think it's healthy for her to be always carrying that doubt.

I don't think it's healthy for **you** to be carrying that doubt either.

"I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not, because it's really not that simple. Do you think ""Banning guns"" will stop people like this from obtaining firearms illegally? Someone like this shooter isn't just going to say ""Aww man, getting a gun is illegal? Guess I won't shoot up the school."" No. They will get the gun illegally, and commit whatever terrible act they are set on doing. 

Just ""Banning guns,"" doesn't solve the problem, as all you're doing is taking guns away from those good citizens that would've used them responsibly, while those who wouldn't (like the shooter) would just get them illegally.",1

"Their plot armor was the fact that they had obvious story arcs that weren't finished. I'm not sure you know what plot armor is?

"I do not see this as valid criticism. I actually see this as criticism for the sake of criticism. Just because none of the 10 fan theories you read came to be true, doesn’t mean you start finding flaws where there aren’t any lol.

Why did the main characters survive? Think about it strong and hard, what possible explanation could there be for Brienne, Jon, Danny, tormund, jamie to survive? Well it’s because all of these guys are exceptional warriors and have been portrayed as such throughout the show (exception Danny but she has dragons lol). Throughout the show, each and every one of these individuals has been shown to be more courageous, more determined, more skilled than the others at combat. If any one survived, it should be these people.

Jorah mormont survives the first charge because he is a more accomplished warrior compared to the dothrakis - there is nothing that should be surprising here. Greyworm survived because he is the leader of the unsullied and why is that? Because he is the best of the unsullied.

Jon and Danny survived because they had dragons and weren’t part of the battle for the most part.

Bran survived because he had a full blown mini army protecting him, plus a certain Arya who is perhaps one of the most accomplished assassins ever to set foot in Westeros.

Why did Tyrion and Sansa survive, because they were the smartest of the people in the crypt and took shelter and hid when others did not think to do so.

I mean if you’re going to talk about plot armor, how the fuck did the night king not die of dragon fire when Danny smoked his ass? I see no one complaining about that.

Yes, the battle of winterfell wasn’t perfect but, for anything that hyped, how can it even be perfect? Out of tens of millions watching the show, there were always going to be subsets who were going to have issues with the story and the plot.

All the people complaining right now, it just makes no sense to me because if you want to talk about plot armor, each and every character has been in extremely dangerous situations before and guess what, they all made it to the last season.  I guess what you folks really wanted is for everyone to die in season 3 lol.",1

Or their seatbelts with built in airbags that prevent bruising and reduce discomfort in a crash. Or the automatic emergency braking, the million camera and sensors arrays, the advanced suspension that gives you a smoother ride and reduces discomfort from potholes and bad roads, etc.

Dogs and cats aren't the only animals that can feel this precious thing called love. And they feel pain as much as you and me. Who likes to feel pain? Who likes being sad? We steal their babies from them as soon as they're born so we can suck all of their milk for us. It makes mother cows bellow and cry for days. If my pain matters then their pain matters too, pain is pain, no matter who feels it. If you don't like causing sadness stop drinking milk, stop eating meat. It's inhumane.

"This whole thread is ignoring the serious moral question. Should society be glad that someone is dead because he committed a crime. I frankly don't understand what stand your ground laws have to with this thread which started when someone commented  ""I am glad he is dead."" Obviously it's not ethical to burglarize someone's house and the action is not excusable at all and it was entirely his choice to enter her home and he had to face the consequences of that. But when someone says ""I am glad he is dead"" it is basically saying that this is the best possible outcome? Is that really the case?

I feel the appropriate response to this should be ""it's unfortunate that she had to kill someone but I am glad she was able to defend her property. Not ""I am glad he is dead.""",1

"I’m almost certain the 12 year old girl wasn’t buying a dildo but rather a clitoral vibrator. Young girls typically use small clitoral vibrators and I’m certain that’s what this girl’s mom agreed to buy her... these vibrators also have no resemblance of a penis either... so is that okay then? 

Additional, it seems you’re under the assumption that all women/young girls can orgasm with just their hands, which is absolutely untrue. Nearly 50% of women need a vibrator to orgasm during masturbation and 5% of women will never orgasm once in their lifetime. So you’re theory that a girl using a vibrator means she’s advancing to something more serious than strictly manual masturbation is flawed, because for a lot of women, including myself, the first time they ever masturbating is with a clitoral vibrator due to their inability to orgasm or even come close to orgasm without it. 

Your last comment is confusing... are you saying it’s okay for a 12 year old to have a vibrator or pocket pussy as long as they sneak around their parents back? It seems you’re making the argument that the reason it was wrong for you to have one at 12 was because it would have made your dad uncomfortable, not because there’s anything wrong with having one?",1

"It’s like we’re right back in 2016 with Bernie supporters telling POC’s that issues which specifically impact their communities don’t matter. A blanket answer of “I’m going to tell everyone racism isn’t tolerated and fix the economy” and “I marched with MLK that one time”, just feels like outright pandering at best, and at worst a complete lack of awareness or understanding of the plight minority groups face. Warren at least was able to offer policy initiatives in the form of addressing the severe disparity in maternal care for black women.

I’m sure there will also be the same dumbfounded reactions from his supporters as it was in 2016 when he again fails to capture votes from minority demographics. His supporters should instead of dismissing the concerns of minorities as “causing division”, or condescending remarks such as “who are they going to vote for trump” (we aren’t even in primary territory yet ffs), put aside their personal feelings and try to listen to their fellow voters concerns, and use that to actively push the campaign to craft a message and policy that addresses them. 

That said, *I* will still vote for whomever wins the primary, but I at least understand the apathy of minority voters who just see more of the same empty hollow promises and platitudes, and simply sit it out because things won’t change regardless, and instead only get worse.",1

"&gt; he moves forward at the zenith if the shot, it’s unlikely to get blocked at that point. 

Correct. But the fact that we're talking about undercut showed that defenders existed somewhat nearby-ish that contested the shot. So jumping forward in this case increases the chance to get blocked (shot failed), and the possibility of getting undercut (injured). That's why I don't think it's natural to do so. 


Defenders will always jump forward to close the gap to the shooter. Shooters have choices whether they jump forward, jump straight, or jump backwards as they needed to depending on the situation. If shooters decided to jump forward when defenders are somewhat nearby-ish, IMO both the shooters and defenders are initiating contact that should result in no calls. I lean toward no calls than double-foul because I want to make sure that shooters trying to create contact is not rewarded in any way. Double-foul is more exploitable than no calls.



A bit off topic, but here's the way I see things:

* You drive a car in the middle lane, then another car hit you from the right lane turning left. It's their fault because you have the right of way driving straight (jump straight).

* You drive a car in the middle lane and turning to left lane (jump backwards), then a car from the right lane turned to left and cut two lanes and hit you. It's their fault for crossing two lanes and hit you. This is what happened with Zaza undercutting Kawhi's fadeaway. 

* You drive in the left lane and turned right to middle lane (jump forward). Another car drives in the right lane and turned left to middle lane. Both cars crashed in the middle lane. I see as both at fault. Either no calls or double fouls. I lean towards no call.",0

Also, rape. You never know. I don’t condone, assume or associate with rapists or rape or calling people that are homosexual, etc. rapists in general. Just. Yeah. 



Sorry for the post, if it makes anyone uncomfortable just DM me and I’ll remove it.

"I’d like to point out something that everyone seems to be skipping. Your daughter’s biological mother is the one who skipped out on Mother’s Day with her child. It’s funny how no one is calling her a cunt or an asshole or saying she’s horrible for not spending Mother’s Day with the child she actually birthed and raised. You don’t even seem upset about that.....but you are angry with your wife, who has only been a step-parent for 3.5 years and only sees your daughters 4 days a month. 

Have you considered that given the length of your marriage and the age of your kids, your daughters likely have never really seen your wife in a motherly role and vice versa? That’s pretty normal. I see it all the time in posts written by step-kids. “I have a mom/dad. I don’t need another one.” “My stepmom is always trying to act like she can tell me what to do.” “My stepdad needs to back off. I don’t need his advice.” Blending families when the kids are preteens and teens doesn’t work like it does when kids are young, especially if Mom or Dad are still fully involved. Parental relationships don’t develop as naturally, if at all. A “fun aunt” or friendly type relation tends to happen in healthy households instead. 

There’s just a lot of information missing from this post. What kind of relationship does your wife have with your daughters? Is she close with them? Has she made overtures? Have they indicated at any time they see her as a mother? Has there been serious tension or bad experiences? Has she been given a motherly role in your daughter’s life? Do you and your ex allow your wife to actually parent? Is she involved in decision making as equally? Would your daughter have wanted to spend Mother’s Day with your wife if her biological mother was available? Has your daughter ever even acknowledged your wife on Mothers day before? 

Depending on the answer to any of those questions, your wife could be being perfectly reasonable or a total asshole. Either way, it’s not particularly fair for you to expect her to “fill-in” because biomom is busy doing something else.",1

"I had a lads holiday in Spain last year and we had two run ins with the police, both times we were doing something wrong.

Both times we left feeling like it was totally fair and reasonable and with no bad feelings towards the cops.

"It’s true. Businesses have pervaded the election process. 

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0

"They're not paying taxes, you as the passenger are paying the taxes. This won't contribute to airlines trying to be more efficient for two reasons.

First, if the cost is passed on to the consumer, then the airline loses nothing and has no incentive for increased efficiency.

Second, planes that are more fuel efficient is a pipedream. We are still flying using technology developed in the 1940's, because we haven't found any alternatives. Airlines don't do research, aerospace companies like lockheed and boeing do research. Even if they had a new technology today, it would take them 30-40 years to get it flight tested, approved, certified, validated, all of which takes up immense funding and produces a greater negative impact that using what we use now.

It's an incredibly naive opinion to think that this is a good idea. The only incentive for creating the tax is to be able to produce more funding for governments. I'm not against taxation like some right wing nutters, but there are many cases where taxation is a poor idea because of how valuable and necessary the commodity is to our society.",0

"&gt;First, let's recall what that dialog looked like

Ok. The dialogue looked like this:

&gt;""There is no evidence of collusion.""

Simple stuff.

&gt;There was an awful lot of smoke being reported by reputable sources, and there's not a single piece that NYT or WaPo or WSJ reported on the Trump-Rusiia front that Mueller Report disproved.

[You're wrong.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/donald-trump-russia-collusion-cia.html)

[I can do this all day.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/17/yes-there-was-collusion-now-what-will-we-do-about-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d7340256626f)

[There are literally dozens of articles.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/not-true-james-comey-denounces-nyt-report-on-trump-campaign-collusion-with-russia-during-testimony)

(Made sure to use WaPo and NYT articles just for you - there are plenty more, too - just let me know if you need them.)

&gt;So all the stuff that happened that caused us to call for an investigation is shit that *really did happen*.

[You mean a false report that was debunked mid investigation?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

&gt;The softening of the RNC platform, the multiple attempts to establish communication backdoors, the contact between Sessions and Kislayak, and him suibsequently lying about it, a ton of other Trump staffers and Trump himself getting caught lying about contact with Russians - all that was real.

\[Sources please.\]

&gt;What's not real is the characterization that there was ""no collusion"" according to the Mueller report. The accurate characterization is that there wasn't enough admissible evidence to indict for it. Here's what the report has to say on the subject in its opening paragraphs:

That's some hard-core mental gymnastics for a huge nothing burger. Try harder. Your opinion is irrelevant. Meullers isn't. And Meuller said: ""No Evidence of Collusion.""

No matter what you may think constitute evidence... it's irrelevant. Meuller found none and your opinion on the matter is now irrelevant. Thanks for sharing it, though.

&gt;The report proceeds to name Flynn, Papadopolous, Cohen and Manafort as those who got charged.

Are you pretending that these people are guilty of collusion? Because literally none were charged with anything remotely resembling collusion.

&gt;That's not a determination that there was no collusion/coordination/conspiracy. That's ""we investigated the campaign and found enough dirt to indict the campaign manager and his right-hand guy along with Flynn and Papadop. Everyone else covered their tracks well enough that we can't bring a case against them.""

If you investigate a murder and find out that the suspect and his buddies are drug dealers... you arrest them for dealing drugs. But that doesn't mean they're murderers.

In this case: If you investigate collusion and find evidence of Tax Fraud (from years prior and not associated with a ""Russian Collusion"" investigation) you arrest them for their crimes - but that doesn't mean you get to label them as a traitor.

You're trying really hard to make 2+2=5.

&gt;Then of course it's followed by a second half of the report that says ""by the way, here's an open-and-shut case on the president obstructing the everloving shit out of our investigation. Did we mention that's a federal felony? Hey Congress, time for you guys to do your job.""

You must have a gold medal for the Mental Gymnastic Olympics.  Do you know how quotes work? Because that was literally never said. You're paraphrasing with a ridiculous bias. You're painting "" ***The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him***,' as ""he is clearly guilty.""

That is blatantly false. It's about as neutral a statement as one can get (and mine is the actual quote).

Look - it's clear you're chomping at the bit to get Trump with something... but why?

What is your obsession with finding him doing something wrong? What would have to happen for you to rethink your position? What event would need to take place in order for you to take a critical look at the treatment of the President of the United States?",1

"I wasn’t saying that dragons in and of themselves existing is the unbelievable thing. Dragons should not exist because they’d collapse under their own weight. It has nothing to do with magic, that’s just science and logic. Same thing with a skeleton hand punching through solid rock. It’s all the same rules of reality that govern gravity, survivability in combat, and the relatively sharpness of weaponry. If those things are okay, then so should someone managing to disentangle themselves from a swarm with the use of their one-shot zombie lightsabers and the aid of close-by allies. Otherwise, you’re utilizing *selective suspension,* where something’s that break reality and logic and somethings aren’t just because you wanted to see some more dead main characters. 

That’s my thing. The more I hear people saying it’s a matter of believability and physics and whatever, the more it just doesn’t add up because if you actually cared about these characters and their struggles and stories and lives, then the fact they did survive despite these insurmountable odds should be joyous. Instead it seems like it matters more that fucking Isaac Newton’s math homework should be respected and just *bitch, bitch, bitch.* If you like these people and this story, then why it is such a big deal? Why the endless debates? Especially when there’s not been a precedent for major characters dying in battle, and statistically speaking, that’s when a main character is the safest. Name me a main character or major supporting character who has died in the thick of battle like everyone seemed to expect this episode. There was Ygritte. That’s the only one who comes to my mind.

I understand it’s an issue, maybe they should have shot those scenes to be less dogpile-y or Arya’s leap should be shorter or whatever else, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad writing or a bad story. It’s bad math and bad physics, but math and physics and even *logic herself* are not the rulers of Story-Town. They can advise on some things, but they do not make the final call. Even in Game of Thrones, they’ve never made the final call. And if that’s your primary concern when it comes to stories, then maybe you need to re-examine your priories.",1

"Feminism *is* about hating men tho, the fact that they are factually correct is not really relevant. Just like how white supremacist can say that black women lead the nation in obesity and STD rates. It may be factually true, but their *objective* is to spread race based hatred. The same is true here, men obviously are more aggressive and are more violent, but femanazis only use that truth in their efforts to spread hatred and fear. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Hate Facts"" as they are known are always a ""carriage in front of the horse"" type of deal. You have to look at what a persons agenda is when you are analyzing their argument. The media railing against men is indeed an attack on men, their hate-facts are just a weapon so it doesnt matter if theyre true. Femanazis agenda includes spreading gender based fear and hatred - so I say fuck them cows.",1
"OK, so this 12-year-old now knows that her dad cheated and is a shitty person. Now what? She’s going to be living with him for the next six years at least, she’s going to be emotionally invested in him likely for the rest of his life, while OP is basically going to be out of her life after this. 

What’s the actual benefit in her knowing the details of this? “Your dad is a shithead who cheated, btw bye see you never!” Great, so the child loses a person who was in her life, and now potentially thinks terribly of and doesn’t trust her actual parent. That’s just perfect! Where do things go from here? Surely up, for those rosy teenage years when nothing ever goes wrong!

OP basically got to drop a bomb and walk out in the aftermath. I am in no way justifying what happened to her. It completely sucks that this person she loved cheated on her, and what the dad did is complete shit. However, it’s not like OP is going to be around to do anything for this kid in the future. So setting fire to the dad‘s relationship with the daughter, doesn’t really accomplish anything except hurting the child.

This sub has an obsession with completely telling the entire truth, regardless of context, at all times. It is an extremely immature mindset lacking nuance. In the real world, telling the entire unvarnished truth is not always the best move.",1

Yet during launch everyone seemed to *love* posting Twitch viewer stats between Apex and Fortnite, showing off how many Twitch viewers Apex had over fortnite. 

The truth is that this game has no new content so there is no reason to play it. A battle royale game getting nothing but a new character and a new gun in ~2 months is pretty bad. Not even a change to the map or any significant balance changes except for an overbuff to the Longbow.

Its possible Charles could abdicate if he got too old and infirm but more likely he would stay King, Prince William would act as a Regent and the family would take up the engagements and work.

"Perhaps Mueller shouldn’t have taken the rather procedurally lazy route of punting the responsibility for indicting Trump to some hypothetical future congress or president, and then this wouldn’t have been an issue in the first place. This idea that one can’t indict a sitting president is not exactly codified law, nor is it necessarily a requirement.

"Sure. I don't know every step of the story from the inside, but here's my take: for two decades people have been rumored to be making Ghostbusters 3. Every year this subreddit would get ""Dan Akroyd says it's happening!"" etc etc, internet fodder going back to the early 200s. Stories of numerous problems putting it together, infighting with the old cast, Bill Murray hating every script, whatever. 

Then, somehow, it gets the greenlight from Sony, and everyone's on board. Fans go insane. The whole original cast. Cool, right? Sorta, no. Sony isn't making Ghostbusters 3, they're making.... some.... parallel Ghostbusters non-sequel with the original cast but they don't play themselves and then other people are the main characters? It got confusing quick.

I don't really want to touch the insane fan reaction of *I swear I don't hate women but it offends me that women replaced men roles in this movie* and *I swear I'm judging the movie fairly but I also spent days tracking the rottentomatoes critic ratings to the original supporters of the movie and they're all paid shills defending feminism omg plz keep politics out of my movies childhood ruined plz i need a father figure* male insecurity - that wouldn't have been predicted easily and still boggles my mind a bit.

Anyway, back to a sorta-non-sequel with the original cast but they're not the original characters. The movie went through some development hell. Extremely expensive reshoots, according to Akroryryd, made the chance of a sequel unprofitable despite meager/good financial figures.

As for the movie itself? I liked it a lot, despite really hating Leslie Jones. She had my fav line of the movie, ""That's like the third scariest thing on that train!""

Now, given what a clusterfuck that whole thing was, they're making an actual Ghostbusters 3.",0
"&gt; There are a lot of misconceptions about these women that are holding them back. People think they've slept with 1000's of men, that they likely have diseases, that they are criminals, that they are probably drug addicts who have become somewhat violent and dangerous as a survival mechanism and have lost touch with the moral norms of society... These are all true,

I married a woman who lied about her history and what she had been up to for most of her life. Believe me, she hid it quite well. There were clues I missed because I lacked context and experience but just the same, from time to time in the year and a half I knew her before getting married she occasionally let slip comments that a more knowledgeable person would have or could have picked up on. Tracing back to through her history and occasional comments, hiring a PI to follow her around when I wasn't home and literally catching her in the act, I had to face the fact she had been a prostitute and still was an active prostitute. She secretly continued using drugs which I found out when I had to call an ambulance after an overdose and her son retrieved the barbiturate container which we showed EMS so they could treat her effectively, and then she blamed me for causing her to use drugs. She would become violent for no particular reason, she was a chronic and skilled liar, she defrauded the immigration system to get here and in the end was hit with an annulment based on fraud and deported with her son. She did lose touch with any form of ethics and social norms. It's not that she didn't know what right and wrong was, she just didn't care. To her, she didn't mind doing anything so long as she wasn't caught. When caught, she declared I was stupid with all my ethics, like, not lying and stealing from family, friends and your spouse. Oh, and not seeing the benefits of prostitution and getting into her ""business"". Even the judge slammed her on these issues. Oh, she talked so sweet and sounded so nice, like the sweet little victim as her attorney fell for her sweet talk and defended her enthusiastically. On the last day of hearings when we brought out all the documents that showed she was lying to everyone including the federal government her own attorney finally realized how badly he'd been misled. He actually believed her. I even felt a bit of pity for him when in utter disgust he threw his carefully thought out notes on the table in disgust. As for her, I felt no pity when I saw the look of shock on her face as the judge granted me annulment based on fraud and slammed his gavel down. Everything she had worked and schemed for destroyed in that moment. I didn't even feel bad when I learned she had been deported. She had her chance and blew it.

Joey Styles: And I think what happened was by not letting the XFL live on its own without any WWE personalities, all of the WWE hating media, right or wrong, jumped on the XFL. and if that didn’t do it, the cheerleaders surely did, because there was sure as hell a big difference between traditional football cheerleaders and the strippers that were cheerleading for the XFL grinding in those outfits.

Eric Bischoff: Had the XFL been a 3 year plan or a 5 year plan, I think it would probably be around today. It would’ve changed the sports industry as we know it.

Bob Costas: I think it should have been as obvious as steering clear of a dark alley in a dangerous neighborhood. Everything about it screamed to me schlock and crap. Everything that subsequently occurred validated that impression. In fairness, Dick Ebersol never asked me. None of the announcers who were associated with NBC were going to be used on this experiment, so there was never any danger of that.

Bruce Prichard: This is developed on the private jet on the way to the first game. On a Wednesday before the first game. We start talking about what we used to do as kids. We used to put a football in the middle of the street and line up at opposite ends and whoever got the football first started with it. It was street football, that’s how we played street football. ""I love it"", Vince said.

It wasn’t discussed with any football people, not discussed with any coaches or players or any input from the football experts — It’s Michael Hayes, Bruce Prichard, Brian Gerwitz, Stephanie McMahon, Vince McMahon, and Dick Ebersol. So we were like, ""What do we call that""? I think Michael Hayes came up with the name ""Scramble"".

**Also, before the XFL premiered, they shot a bunch of promos highlighting the cheerleaders. There was only one problem: they were all dancers. They touted the cheerleaders as having day jobs like one being a doctor and one being a teacher except they were all dancers. Here’s what Bruce Prichard said about that.**

Bruce Prichard: So, I end the meeting kind of abruptly and I grabbed this lady and I said ""What the fuck""? I can make shit work, but now I’ve got to go back and explain to Vince that I got a chick that likes to read math books, I got a chick that works at a lawyer office, a chick that used to work at a doctor’s office or a chick that wanted to be a lawyer and um…

Conrad: Two dozen dancers.

Bruce Prichard: They’re all dancers! And I said ""What the fuck?"" ""Well, tomorrow will be a better group"". ""I’ve got to shoot shit today!""

Conrad: Yeah

Bruce Prichard: So, essentially, I just made shit up.

(Conrad laughs hard)

Bruce Prichard: I took the bitch that worked at a lawyer’s office, I put her in a lawyer’s office, man. I had her be a lawyer.

Conrad: Coming in hot with that language.

Bruce Prichard: I had the one— oh, this is another good one. This was one, we’ve got a sport trainer or something like that. So, I go talk to her. She dateda trainer in high school. I said ""Well, great. You’re gonna be my athletic trainer"". I took the chick that liked to read math books— now, get this: she liked to read math books but she hated math and she couldn’t do any math problems. So, I had to have her go bring me one of those math books and we just did a complicated math problem on the wall. And here’s my favorite part of all. When we divvied up crews and everything, I said ""You know what? I’ll take these girls, Michael, you and Brian, you go take these girls, and you take your crew and I’ll do my crew"". Well, I made it so that my crew and all my girls, I could shoot everything right there at the stadium. I just did backstage stuff and I made a training room, I made a classroom, I just made shit up there. And Stephanie McMahon stayed with me and helped me produce and Michael and them were up until the wee hours of the morning having to shoot stuff on location in Las Vegas. It SUCKKKKKKED. Because they were just local dancers.",1

I had this happen as Kled vs an Urgot. I was definitely way in the kill range (sub 100 hp), got Skarl, got hit by those **SHOTGUN KNEES** then he reeled me in with chain.

"Who knows, probably? With new games its do or die, so I wouldn't be surprised if they were all working OT to try and get their game out of Beta.

Back then it was the creators of the game and their relatively medium sized team who had a background in other mobas prior to LoL and each person had a job and they did it. Back in the day each 2 weeks a new champion was released, they were overpowered as fuck but eventually got fixed and put into a more balanced space.

Their 2 week patch cycle has enabled the team to go back into champions with problems in their kits and make the required adjustments to make them fall in line with what they considered balanced at the time.

The problem with Apex not releasing a legend every month or two a season is that they're getting stuck into a routine where they do balance patches once a month if that, so if they randomly spun up production of legends they'd fall into a pit of agony where legends released balanced but they don't have the tool and work ethic to keep the new guys balanced.

So my problem with Apex as it is right now, if they don't fix their content spacing (Which they said they're firmly not adjusting) they'll never increase the production of legends or new content.

I can tell you right now in 3 years time, Apex will still only be releasing 1 legend and gun(if that) per season, never more. This just isn't enough content to keep players interested in the long run.

Those who complain that players like me are complaining too early fail to realize that we're able to foresee the outcome that isn't looking good and if we get complacent Respawn will use that to their advantage saying ""our players don't want to be overwhelmed"" and justify their inability to produce quality content at a reasonable time spacing.",0

"""I love it,"" he says. ""I love the hitting. I love making the big play. I love being out there with my teammates. I love the camaraderie. I can't say I always love practice. But it's a means to an end. I want to have those big performances, those games you talk about years down the line. I want to win those big playoff games. I want to win a Super Bowl. I want to hold up the trophy. I want to splash Champagne on my teammates. I want to take care of my family for generations. I want to have my head turned into a bust in the Hall of Fame.

""Those things can only happen if I'm doing the best I can each and every day, looking out for my teammates and keeping out of trouble.""

Former Browns defensive line coach Clyde Simmons says Garrett ""has a chance to be one of the greats, as long as he stays healthy and continues to work on his craft."" In January, Simmons, who played defensive end in an era when nasty was a prerequisite for his position, also said he thinks there are ""some little things in there that I think he could be a little bit more aggressive about, a little nastier about.""

To which Garrett says: ""I'm the kind of guy who is always respectful of the game. I want to beat you, but I don't want to do anything dirty. I want to do it the clean way. You don't want to do something that hurts the team.""

During practices one fall at Texas A&amp;M, 6'5"", 325-pound offensive tackle Germain Ifedi grew frustrated after repeatedly being shown up by Garrett. On one play, Garrett long-armed the blocker, and his arm slid up to his throat. Ifedi, who now is with the Seahawks, threw a punch. Garrett avoided it. Then Ifedi charged Garrett.

Instead of fighting back, Garrett extended his arm, grabbed Ifedi's facemask and held him at bay. Ifedi kept swinging but couldn't connect.

That's Garrett—thoughtful and forceful at once.

Garrett realizes the mind is a powerful thing, even in a physical confrontation. Thomas helped him understand how to be a thinking man's defensive end by studying the offensive tackle Garrett would oppose each week during his rookie year. Thomas would  then give him three moves he thought could exploit his weaknesses.

""The nicest thing I can say about him is he's got the brain of an offensive lineman,"" Thomas says. ""He's not like your typical dumb defensive lineman. He's cerebral and thoughtful, and that really helps with the way he attacks offensive linemen.""

The forces within Garrett are not oppositional. They are complementary, yin and yang.

This is how he sees it: ""I'm caring and loving and supportive of people who have been forces in my life and have guided me where I am today. But football is my job. If I lose my job, I can't be supportive of the people who have been there for me. The person in front of me is trying to take my job. I have to whup him, or he beats me and takes my job. I'm not going to let that happen. I'm not out there to injure anybody, but I'm out there to hurt your will and make sure you don't want to do it anymore, take away your will to keep on fighting.""

Of course, like any good poet, he has a vision.

He can become one of the legends of the game, like Lawrence Taylor. ""I want to have the same impact on the game as LT,"" he says. ""That's big talk because he's one of the best ever. But it's doable.

""I want to go down as the greatest player to ever play.""",1

"It’s true. Businesses have pervaded the election process. 

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0

but I digress

retail is absolutely physically exploitative. good friend of mine needed a full knee replacement as a teenager bc the stepladder broke underneath them while retrieving 50 pound bags of cat litter from the top shelf (those bags aren't stackable so management liked to have them up top). management didn't pay a cent cause they had provided a too-short stepladder, forcing them to use that top step that's ""not a step."" that way, when it DID break, they could say the worker knowingly did something unsafe &amp; is responsible. she continued to work there &amp; in fact works there to this day bc she got kicked out for being gay, so no choice. she interviewed other places but the management of her current job told them all she sued them for workman's comp so none of them would hire her. oh, and her pay got docked. she picked up another 2 very similar, very low-paying jobs to make up for it.

another friend from further back, somewhere around 12, was working under the table for an uncle who wanted her at the shop doors at 4am so she could get things ready for him to open before she went to school every day &amp; then close for him every night. she took drugs to counter the sleep deprivation &amp; walked to the store alone, in the dark. her parents were abusive &amp; made her pay rent, so she couldn't quit.

Half of reddit is complaining about dumb stuff like oh it’s too dark, oh this battle strategy in this fantasy show isn’t realistic, after years of subversion and having main characters die; they subvert is again by not having one main character die. As for the “someone dies if they make mistakes”, this isn’t true, many people have been ex machina’d many times in S1-4. Jon should have died in seasons 1-4, Dany should have died in the slave arena and Samwell sure as shit should have died in S1-4 so I don’t wanna hear mistakes would always lead to death when that’s not true",1

Considering that Aerys was threatening to burn the ""innocents"" freshly knighted Jaime swore to protect, considering that Jaime knew about his abuse of Rhaella, considering that ""uhh Jaime, bring me your dad's head"" and considering that he had already killed the pyromancer...that decision makes complete sense.

"I do not see this as valid criticism. I actually see this as criticism for the sake of criticism. Just because none of the 10 fan theories you read came to be true, doesn’t mean you start finding flaws where there aren’t any lol.

Why did the main characters survive? Think about it strong and hard, what possible explanation could there be for Brienne, Jon, Danny, tormund, jamie to survive? Well it’s because all of these guys are exceptional warriors and have been portrayed as such throughout the show (exception Danny but she has dragons lol). Throughout the show, each and every one of these individuals has been shown to be more courageous, more determined, more skilled than the others at combat. If any one survived, it should be these people.

Jorah mormont survives the first charge because he is a more accomplished warrior compared to the dothrakis - there is nothing that should be surprising here. Greyworm survived because he is the leader of the unsullied and why is that? Because he is the best of the unsullied.

Jon and Danny survived because they had dragons and weren’t part of the battle for the most part.

Bran survived because he had a full blown mini army protecting him, plus a certain Arya who is perhaps one of the most accomplished assassins ever to set foot in Westeros.

Why did Tyrion and Sansa survive, because they were the smartest of the people in the crypt and took shelter and hid when others did not think to do so.

I mean if you’re going to talk about plot armor, how the fuck did the night king not die of dragon fire when Danny smoked his ass? I see no one complaining about that.

Yes, the battle of winterfell wasn’t perfect but, for anything that hyped, how can it even be perfect? Out of tens of millions watching the show, there were always going to be subsets who were going to have issues with the story and the plot.

All the people complaining right now, it just makes no sense to me because if you want to talk about plot armor, each and every character has been in extremely dangerous situations before and guess what, they all made it to the last season.  I guess what you folks really wanted is for everyone to die in season 3 lol.",1

"What a lot of people here don't understand is that our wars in the middle east have done exactly what they were designed to do. Cost us taxpayers money and destabilize the middle east. The last several administrations have all had the goal of using our power for their own interests while syphoning it off to weaken us and strengthen our enemies. It was never intended to stabilize or build allies. Only to create chaos. Evil can thrive where there is chaos.

This is different. Trump is different. We can be a force for good in the world. And we can do it without caving to globalist pressures. We've done it in the past. Our greatest allies are vibrant powerful cultures because we came in and took over and rebuilt them in our image. We can do that for Venezuela too.

Doing nothing will just make the situation worse and untold numbers of people will die because we did nothing. It could even create a domino effect that collapses a large part of South America, exactly like what has been done in the middle east. And those people's lives will be used as a weapon to destroy us. It's already beginning. Massive migrations north, just like the middle east. If we do nothing, we will be the ones who ""deserve what we voted for"" while our nation falls to the same pressures.

Sticking our head in the sand doesn't make the world go away. The world is a dangerous place with dangerous forces in play. Not all players are nations. Not all wars are fought with tanks and guns. We are the only thing propping up freedom and liberty in the world. And there are a lot of people out there with a lot of power who do not like that and will do anything and use anyone to destroy us.

So no, I don't believe doing nothing is an option.",0

"Tbh I saw the central point of GoT being humans being too caught up in their own troubles to actually see the real existential threat that had been warned about since the first scene of Episode 1, that despite knowing that Winter Is Coming, people dont pay it heed.              
&amp;nbsp;        
Tbh, my issue is not with Arya getting the kill. She has the skills, but my issue is that the NK has been reduced to Big Bad Antagonist who is evil for the sake of evil despite that being a huge trope that GRRM has specifically said he wanted to avoid, mentioning LotR.               
&amp;nbsp;           
If we're talking about giving Aryas training meaning, have her kill cersei. Shes been on her list forever, and her training is literally to be an assassin, not a power ranger for the lord of light.           
&amp;nbsp;           
That wouldn't be a trope either, thats just having a coherent plot.                 
If Arya kills Cersei now, I'll be annoyed she is the one character to win GoT, but if she doesn't I'll be annoyed because who the fuck is a better fit to kill her. Arya is the only one who could waltz into the red keep and kill her no effort, so if she doesnt why TF not.

"""I love it,"" he says. ""I love the hitting. I love making the big play. I love being out there with my teammates. I love the camaraderie. I can't say I always love practice. But it's a means to an end. I want to have those big performances, those games you talk about years down the line. I want to win those big playoff games. I want to win a Super Bowl. I want to hold up the trophy. I want to splash Champagne on my teammates. I want to take care of my family for generations. I want to have my head turned into a bust in the Hall of Fame.

""Those things can only happen if I'm doing the best I can each and every day, looking out for my teammates and keeping out of trouble.""

Former Browns defensive line coach Clyde Simmons says Garrett ""has a chance to be one of the greats, as long as he stays healthy and continues to work on his craft."" In January, Simmons, who played defensive end in an era when nasty was a prerequisite for his position, also said he thinks there are ""some little things in there that I think he could be a little bit more aggressive about, a little nastier about.""

To which Garrett says: ""I'm the kind of guy who is always respectful of the game. I want to beat you, but I don't want to do anything dirty. I want to do it the clean way. You don't want to do something that hurts the team.""

During practices one fall at Texas A&amp;M, 6'5"", 325-pound offensive tackle Germain Ifedi grew frustrated after repeatedly being shown up by Garrett. On one play, Garrett long-armed the blocker, and his arm slid up to his throat. Ifedi, who now is with the Seahawks, threw a punch. Garrett avoided it. Then Ifedi charged Garrett.

Instead of fighting back, Garrett extended his arm, grabbed Ifedi's facemask and held him at bay. Ifedi kept swinging but couldn't connect.

That's Garrett—thoughtful and forceful at once.

Garrett realizes the mind is a powerful thing, even in a physical confrontation. Thomas helped him understand how to be a thinking man's defensive end by studying the offensive tackle Garrett would oppose each week during his rookie year. Thomas would  then give him three moves he thought could exploit his weaknesses.

""The nicest thing I can say about him is he's got the brain of an offensive lineman,"" Thomas says. ""He's not like your typical dumb defensive lineman. He's cerebral and thoughtful, and that really helps with the way he attacks offensive linemen.""

The forces within Garrett are not oppositional. They are complementary, yin and yang.

This is how he sees it: ""I'm caring and loving and supportive of people who have been forces in my life and have guided me where I am today. But football is my job. If I lose my job, I can't be supportive of the people who have been there for me. The person in front of me is trying to take my job. I have to whup him, or he beats me and takes my job. I'm not going to let that happen. I'm not out there to injure anybody, but I'm out there to hurt your will and make sure you don't want to do it anymore, take away your will to keep on fighting.""

Of course, like any good poet, he has a vision.

He can become one of the legends of the game, like Lawrence Taylor. ""I want to have the same impact on the game as LT,"" he says. ""That's big talk because he's one of the best ever. But it's doable.

""I want to go down as the greatest player to ever play.""",1

"There are over 7,500 universities and 5,500 fraternity chapters in America. Hazing is bound to happen at some of them, especially in south and to be honest, conservative states in general, but it's not the gold standard, and not all hazing is the 3rd degree shit that you read about online. IFC (official) frats are also far less likely to haze. It's the non-IFC frats that haze, and haze hard (even at my alma mater) - so avoid them like the plague.

Additionally, the definition of hazing is so damn murky. At my alma mater, hazing was loosely defined by the administration as making someone do something they don't want to do. Is an event where everyone has to play Edward 40 hands really hazing? How about memorizing the Greek alphabet and chapter/fraternity history (which is easy to remember), then getting quizzed and having to do push-ups if you get the answers wrong? How about scavenger hunts that involved fun, but questionable activities? How about cleaning the frat house after parties we also went to? The only event that I think was actual hazing was the night they brought strippers to the house. In addition to normal things like lap dances and making us lay down and hold lollipops in our mouth that would penetrate them as they rode our faces, they also shit talked, smacked, and straight up whipped some of us while everyone, including our fellow pledge brothers, laughed our asses off at the madness. It was a fucking blast.

Exemptions for things like disabilities were **always** made, and in retrospect, a lot these were just team building exercises, as unifying everyone against the dick pledgemaster was similar to how boot camp and drill sergeants, just a thousand times easier. The wild shit that my pledge brothers and I endured is why the bonds I have with them are stronger than the bonds I have with any other friends I've ever made. Some fraternities go a bit harder, but as long as it doesn't endanger your health or sanity, it'll be drowned out by all the fun nights and you'll oddly look bad at it fondly. Pledge is universally known as ""the best time you'll never want to have again,"" and it truly is that.


One thing I'd like to add for anyone who wants to or is currently pledging: if the fraternity you're pledging starts *really* hazing you, eg, putting your life in danger, physically harming you, and taking things like the yelling too far to the point that you can't handle it emotionally, then drop. That is, unless you plan on going into the military, in which case it's good practice, because the military hazes harder than pretty much any modern frat.",1

No. They will get the gun illegally, and commit whatever terrible act they are set on doing.

"&gt; Back then reaching 90 points was extremely difficult

"""I love it,"" he says. ""I love the hitting. I love making the big play. I love being out there with my teammates. I love the camaraderie. I can't say I always love practice. But it's a means to an end. I want to have those big performances, those games you talk about years down the line. I want to win those big playoff games. I want to win a Super Bowl. I want to hold up the trophy. I want to splash Champagne on my teammates. I want to take care of my family for generations. I want to have my head turned into a bust in the Hall of Fame.

""Those things can only happen if I'm doing the best I can each and every day, looking out for my teammates and keeping out of trouble.""

Former Browns defensive line coach Clyde Simmons says Garrett ""has a chance to be one of the greats, as long as he stays healthy and continues to work on his craft."" In January, Simmons, who played defensive end in an era when nasty was a prerequisite for his position, also said he thinks there are ""some little things in there that I think he could be a little bit more aggressive about, a little nastier about.""

To which Garrett says: ""I'm the kind of guy who is always respectful of the game. I want to beat you, but I don't want to do anything dirty. I want to do it the clean way. You don't want to do something that hurts the team.""

During practices one fall at Texas A&amp;M, 6'5"", 325-pound offensive tackle Germain Ifedi grew frustrated after repeatedly being shown up by Garrett. On one play, Garrett long-armed the blocker, and his arm slid up to his throat. Ifedi, who now is with the Seahawks, threw a punch. Garrett avoided it. Then Ifedi charged Garrett.

Instead of fighting back, Garrett extended his arm, grabbed Ifedi's facemask and held him at bay. Ifedi kept swinging but couldn't connect.

That's Garrett—thoughtful and forceful at once.

Garrett realizes the mind is a powerful thing, even in a physical confrontation. Thomas helped him understand how to be a thinking man's defensive end by studying the offensive tackle Garrett would oppose each week during his rookie year. Thomas would  then give him three moves he thought could exploit his weaknesses.

""The nicest thing I can say about him is he's got the brain of an offensive lineman,"" Thomas says. ""He's not like your typical dumb defensive lineman. He's cerebral and thoughtful, and that really helps with the way he attacks offensive linemen.""

The forces within Garrett are not oppositional. They are complementary, yin and yang.

This is how he sees it: ""I'm caring and loving and supportive of people who have been forces in my life and have guided me where I am today. But football is my job. If I lose my job, I can't be supportive of the people who have been there for me. The person in front of me is trying to take my job. I have to whup him, or he beats me and takes my job. I'm not going to let that happen. I'm not out there to injure anybody, but I'm out there to hurt your will and make sure you don't want to do it anymore, take away your will to keep on fighting.""

Of course, like any good poet, he has a vision.

He can become one of the legends of the game, like Lawrence Taylor. ""I want to have the same impact on the game as LT,"" he says. ""That's big talk because he's one of the best ever. But it's doable.

""I want to go down as the greatest player to ever play.""",1

And for the record, there's nothing wrong with being bi. I think part of the problem is people desperate to deny being bi because they see it as unacceptable. You like jerkin it with other dudes, you're a lil bi, *and that's okay*.

Hey downvoters, explain to me how wanting to jerk it with other dudes *isn't* bi.

"You don't get to just get better health insurance, that's really not how it works at all. Without using your employer subsidized plan, which usually is only one option, you are stuck using the markets or other crappy plans. There is no ""negotiating"", the plans are the plans.

Your employer is providing quite a huge portion of your healthcare costs, you just don't see it. You have an extremely above average experience in the market. Maybe look at these to see the actual costs people are paying on average.

Also, no one is saying ""free healthcare"" as that's not a thing. People want Medicare for all, or a public option at the very least, aka paid for with progressive tax rates like every other developed nation does, without bankrupting its citizens.

Don't forget, if you miss time due to illness or injury, there are little to no protections keeping Americans jobs while they recover, and it is purely up to the discretion of the employer to keep them on payroll. If you get dropped from a job for that, you are also losing your only source of healthcare, and moving to new plans usually requires a 3-6 month window of no coverage.

"Not trying to argue or say you are wrong by any means (in fact, consensus opinion would seem to dictate that *I* am the one wrong), but this is why I don't understand. Here would be my breakdown of the same points.

Plot: Nothing special. Truly, it's a standard point A to point B plot, with a fresh coat of dusty, Australian paint. 

Soundtrack: Awesome, I agree.

Sound mixing: Eh, I mean I have no complaints and I guess that's all you can ask for. ""Incredible"" though implies it should stand out, which it never did to me.

Direction: With a plot this simple, I really cannot see many directors *not* ""delivering what it set out to do."" Not saying he did not do a good job, or that his own personal style did not heavily influence the film, but again I don't understand why so many people treat the direction here as godlike.

Cast: Hardy could have been any actor and it would have made no difference. I have no complaints over him, but Max as a character is hardly a difficult role. Charlize, great, I agree. Supporting cast, great, I agree.

Design: Great, I agree. Exceptional worldbuilding!

Editing: The movie made sense and flowed well. Again, with a plot this simple, I do not see this as a particularly marvelous accomplishment.

Again, these are just my opinions! I am not saying they're right or better than the general consensus. This is just my point of view on it. My biggest gripe is probably the plot, which the average person seemed to think was incredible, whereas I thought it was *at the absolute best,* serviceable. When measured up against other action movies, it does not stand out in the least. The strongest element was the worldbuilding to me, by a mile. Remarkable job on that aspect. :)",1

Reddit and social media do love to blow things up and make assumptions. Not that they don't have some justification for assuming someone who attacked their pregnant girlfriend is a piece of shit.

That is a very solid and fair point but I feel like it cuts both ways. The fact that there is so much criticism just shows how little was done to make this moment as outstanding as it deserves to be. Just because we have different complaints or desires does not mean they are mutually exclusive. You are right that they were never going to please everyone but did they honestly please anyone? I see a lot of people accepting the outcome and desperately trying to backfill with bits and pieces from the past in the story to make it mean something.

"Whilst that’s all true, how many of those things are why (according to reports, which _could_ be wrong) one person brought a gun in to target one specific person? It’s just someone with a beef with access to a gun, in a country with a history of mass shootings, so a shooting seems like a feasible option.

I live in a country without guns, if someone had somehow massively pissed someone off it wouldn’t cross anyone’s mind to get a gun and carry out a shooting as it’s just not a feasible option.  Sure, my country probably has a very similar amount of unhinged people per capita, but without guns there is no possibility of gun crime or, at least, a massively reduced possibility.  

I don’t think it’s an either / or, situation.  It’s all the reasons you mentioned, as well as the simple reason that if people are unhinged, have access to gun, and live in a country with private media whose interests it is in to make a big deal out of mass shooters, settling disputes this way seems to be a regular occurrence.",0

No, I don't need to tell my dad that the reason I'm sitting here crying is because of a band that broke up a year ago who I just found out exists but have become very attached to because all 3 members are trans men, like me.  Yes, even if he asks, I will lie and say ""something reminded me of my dead cat"" or something that doesn't feel like a dumb reason to be sad.

"I have my Vizio 55” LED I bought in 2012 (then $400) set on factory “Calibrated” settings and I could see everything just fine. 

Just to test things out, I even went through and set my TV on every other factory preset available (roughly 5 different presets) and they were all extremely dark like all the complaints I’ve seen about it. 

I’m not trying to say this guy is 100% right but it is possible that a good bit of viewers have their settings on too dark and just don’t know. 

Again, not trying to insult anyone’s intelligence, just speaking from personal experience with a 7 year old TV from a manufacturer that’s probably not top notch quality to begin with. I can only imagine what things look like on an LG OLED or Samsung QLED.",1

YTA if the baby screams non stop the parents are obviously aware of it and likely extremely exhausted in which case moving is gonna be difficult and likely make the baby more unsettled.

He did get a chance to attack him on Titan and at least he knows Thanos is dead, but Drax was just one of many people who had unfinished business with Thanos. I hope they at least address it somewhat in GOTG Vol. 3 that Drax can finally be at peace with that happened to his wife and daughter. It's just the nature of the movie business. When Drax is the 3rd billed star of his own film series and the 22nd and 25th billed star in the credits of the Avengers series, you can't expect him to be the one to deliver the killing blow.",0
"Boyhood felt like one of those movies that Hollywood loves because it circlejerks being in Hollywood and how Hollywood everything is, but this time it was about suburban life instead.

"Not the asshole. A smart man takes advantage of situations like this. Back in the day we used to have a theme park here in Memphis called Liberty Land and when the mid-south fair came, you could get wrist bands that let you enjoy all the rides you want plus you get into Liberty Land for free.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, because the fair took up all the sparking for Liberty Lands parking lot people parked along the street and in other peoples yards. (yes, on the GRASS).

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone on my block took advantage of this to make bank. I charged peopled $25 to park in my driveway and in my yard. 

&amp;#x200B;

We always put up signs in our yard saying ""$25 for parking"" and people would pay it because you could literally walk from my house to the fair/Liberty Land in 3 minutes. It's right across the street. lol

Sometimes I would get 20 different cars a day. Easy little $500. Just had to be willing not to go anywhere that day because your driveway and yard would be full of cars. lol",1

You may never know the true answer unless you catch her texting this person or in the act of doing something.

And for the record, there's nothing wrong with being bi. I think part of the problem is people desperate to deny being bi because they see it as unacceptable. You like jerkin it with other dudes, you're a lil bi, *and that's okay*.

Hey downvoters, explain to me how wanting to jerk it with other dudes *isn't* bi.

Consider: He could have been continuously raising the fallen soldiers from the Winterfell army throughout the battle, but instead he waited until the majority of his original army had been killed, so the defenders of Winterfell would have their hopes crushed seeing what they thought was approaching victory turn into a battle against an entirely new set of enemies.",0

"U see that's problems people face in long relations its like marriage . 

For it to last sacrifices must be done .

Why me not him ? 

For how long ?

For ever ? 

First :

In life ( relationships included )

You should behave based on what you consider right , not what is in your interest or liking .

What you consider right ( your moral code ) is different than others ( even if its in details only - devils are in them ) . 


If we don't agree on the first part , i wish all the best for you , do what feels right ( its ur life , live it ) ; don't over think it .

No matter what choice you take , you are still a great human being .


If we do agree , help me to help you if god may help me to help you .


If you married him , he got into an accident , lost a limb , became bitter all his life .
What then ? 


The right action must be taken with complete belief in it to the point where you don't feel it as a burden , no matter how hard its . 

Its like grasping for air , but i will fkin grasp for it every time i miss it , i will never take death as answer just because the grasping is hard .

My beautiful friend , you might stay and he turn to be the demon him self , does this make ur choice of staying wrong ?

I don't think so .


But you will always know that there might have been a chance if you stayed ( maybe not as a burden - yet as a fact ) . --- this doesn't really matter


Do you think you will find what he is missing in other person ?

Yah probably that's it ...  --- that's not serious


Oh no its just the circumstance ...

So you will keep running at every fall ?


You must understand that either you live for yourself , or  
you live for what you believe is the ultimate good .

Or

Yet we can also say he is treating you bad , leave him .

That's not wrong the slightest .

Yet its your choice , both choices are completely right .",0

" Man, I have nightmares about this. I've been with my fiance for almost 7 years. I know 7 years isn't nearly as long as an elderly couple who's been married more than half their life, but we have one of those once in a lifetime connections that feels like we grew up together, as if we've always known each other. My absolute worst fear is losing him. My entire world revolves around him, I truly don't know what I would do. Just a few years ago, my neighbor who has lived in the apartment right below mine for years, drove literally 2 blocks down the street to the gas station and was t-boned by a teenager who picked that moment to drag race down the main street. Her own teenage son was in the passenger seat and he walked away with a few bruises thank god, but the mother was nearly crushed to death and had to be freed from the car with the ""jaws of life."" I saw the wreckage first hand - I was heading to the same gas station but luckily 10 minutes later. I'll never forget seeing chunks of metal and debris trailing for half a mile down the street, I kept finding bits several months later. She survived but broke both legs and her pelvis was shattered. Now she's permanently disabled due to chronic pain and I'm sure some level of PTSD. Just think, it only happened because some stupid teenager made one bad impulsive decision at that moment. The idea that random accidents can happen to anyone at any time really scares me. Of course it's best not to dwell on it, just hug your loved one tight and never take their presence for granted!",0

My mental health was destroyed in those months, and I lost all of my belongings that were in our shared home. Turns out he was living with someone else while I was gone. I found out by turning up to see what was going on, and he was no longer there. 


I know how it feels to try and be cool about it, making up excuses to cover up what’s going on. It feels like there’s something to be embarrassed of.

Email exchanges between the CPS and its Swedish counterparts over the high-profile case were deleted after the lawyer at the UK end retired in 2014. The destruction of potentially sensitive and revealing information comes ahead of a tribunal hearing in London next week.* **Adding to the intrigue, it emerged the CPS lawyer involved had, unaccountably, advised the Swedes in 2010 or 2011 not to visit London to interview Assange. An interview at that time could have prevented the long-running embassy standoff.""**

""A 46,XY mother who developed as a normal woman underwent spontaneous puberty, reached menarche, menstruated regularly, experienced two unassisted pregnancies, and gave birth to a 46,XY daughter with complete gonadal dysgenesis...

Herein we report the extraordinary case of *a fertile woman* with normal ovaries and a *predominantly 46,XY ovarian karyotype*, who gave birth to a 46,XY female with complete gonadal dysgenesis. The karyotype of this phenotypically normal mother was 46,XY in blood, 80% 46,XY and 20% 45,X in cultured skin fibroblasts, and 93% 46,XY, 6% 45,X, and &lt;1% 46,XX in the ovary. The family pedigree on the mother’s side was notable for the presence of seven individuals over four generations with either sexual ambiguity, infertility, or failure to menstruate, including one individual with documented 45,X/45,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Both the mother and the 46,XY daughter were screened for mutations in a number of genes known to be involved in mammalian testis determination. In all genes screened (see below), the open reading frame was found to be normal. This suggests that a mutation in a novel sex-determination gene or a gene that predisposes to chromosomal mosaicism may be responsible for the phenotype in this family...

Maternity testing was performed by using the short tandem repeat kit AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nine short tandem repeats were analyzed (D3S1358, VWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) using thermal cycling conditions, capillary electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and products were analyzed using the ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis instrument and GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems).""

We had the Port Arthur massacre in 1996. Following this, 640,000 guns were taken off the streets. Since then, we've had a mass shooting involving a single family in Perth (either this year or last IIRC), and the Lindt cafe seige in 2014, by a terrorist. We've had absolutely nothing on the scale of the sorts of attacks frequently happening in America. Its really not that complicated.

Sure, theres still illegal guns floating around the country, and they'll never get every single gun off the streets, but for the most part all we hear of here in Kangarooville are drug dealers being caught with the odd gun here and there.

"That's absolutely incorrect;

""A 46,XY mother who developed as a normal woman underwent spontaneous puberty, reached menarche, menstruated regularly, experienced two unassisted pregnancies, and gave birth to a 46,XY daughter with complete gonadal dysgenesis...

Herein we report the extraordinary case of *a fertile woman* with normal ovaries and a *predominantly 46,XY ovarian karyotype*, who gave birth to a 46,XY female with complete gonadal dysgenesis. The karyotype of this phenotypically normal mother was 46,XY in blood, 80% 46,XY and 20% 45,X in cultured skin fibroblasts, and 93% 46,XY, 6% 45,X, and &lt;1% 46,XX in the ovary. The family pedigree on the mother’s side was notable for the presence of seven individuals over four generations with either sexual ambiguity, infertility, or failure to menstruate, including one individual with documented 45,X/45,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Both the mother and the 46,XY daughter were screened for mutations in a number of genes known to be involved in mammalian testis determination. In all genes screened (see below), the open reading frame was found to be normal. This suggests that a mutation in a novel sex-determination gene or a gene that predisposes to chromosomal mosaicism may be responsible for the phenotype in this family...

Maternity testing was performed by using the short tandem repeat kit AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nine short tandem repeats were analyzed (D3S1358, VWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) using thermal cycling conditions, capillary electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and products were analyzed using the ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis instrument and GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems).""

Talk about/make it clear what both your future plans are. Towards the end of the conversation, drop a ""(...) And i really want to get married soonish.""

Do not, by any means, use even slightly suggestive or ""pushing towards my opinion"" words in that conversation.

"Popes cannot be formal heretics - they are outside the Church at that point, and a Pope must be Catholic. But no-one can remove a Pope.

Benedict appears to have renounced only the ""munus"" of the papacy, intending to continue in a ""contemplative"" capacity. This is a big problem. The sede of St Peter cannot be bifurcated. The argument is that if this was truly Benedict's intent, then he renounced in error and thus invalidly.

At the same time, if he renounced due to threats as some allege, then again he did not renounce freely, and again this would be canonically invalid. If his renunciation was invalid, so was the following conclave and election, and Benedict remains Pope. 

The question around Bergoglio is whether there was a campaign for his election - if so, and it appears there was (ref the St Gallen Mafia), then the election was invalid. There's far more to it than I can do justice here - I generally point people towards Ann Barnhardt (Barnhardt.biz) for clearer explanation.",0

"Best accomplishment in this game to date happened last night... Won 6 games in a row on Xbox yesterday with 2 randoms, no mics.  Grouped up after we won the first game we played together, won 5 more in a row, went to bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's the point of this other than to blow myself?

&amp;#x200B;

I play with 2 friends regularly that are two of the best shooters I've seen, both are probably better than myself and the two randoms I played with last night, however we have never won more than 3 games in a row and at times I get very very frustrated playing with them. Frustrations come from them lagging behind, looting mid fight when we are full up, saying ""right here"" and not pinging, calling out exactly where I am going or who I we are pushing, setting a portal for them, then putting down 2 of 3 enemies and the third kills me with my teammates no where to be found when they had 30 secs to a minute before I even engaged to go to the ping.

&amp;#x200B;

I never at any point had anything other than a smile on my face while playing with my new teammates.  There were multiple times when any one of us had to clutch and respawn or revive, a lot of butt puckering moments, but it proves to me that play styles and synergy will always trump raw skill.  These random teammates were aggressive like me, but understood perfectly the dynamics of a fight. Understood focused fire, positioning, being close enough to engage and not be no help 100-200M away with a sniper, and ping EVERYTHING. Understood we were all good enough to do significant damage that if someone went down they probably nearly killed 2 people and it is ok to reengage without a full freakin purple shield every time. They understood how to stay alive through small movements in cover for long enough for back up to arrive, and they understood that you can still be hyper aggressive and kill 20-30 enemies per game while having patience for the right moments.  I have over 2K season one kills with wraith, 100+ wins, 500K+ damage done, have multiple, good friends that I play with and this was easily the most consistent fun throughout a play session I have had in this game to date.",0

"It’s true. Businesses have pervaded the election process. 

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0

The amount of people that came out in support of the opposition was tiny, only a dozen soldiers actually defected and Guaido still had the nerve to call for the uprising, basically, willing to throw unarmed humans on professional well-armed soldiers. 

Maduro is a shitty leader but as Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Iraq have proved of the last two decades a shitty leader is better than a failed state and a civil war. 

He should act now and jail all the opposition leaders, he has a perfect excuse for that – calling for an uprising and a military coup is not how democracy should work. 

Maduro is authoritarian, sure, but opposition not only have proved to lack popular support but demonstrated its readiness to use violence as a toll.",1

I realize people are thinking of wealthy oligarchs pulling all the strings when they say phrases like this, but ultimately the government has all the real power. Whatever controls the police and army has the real power. Wealthy businessmen can easily be destroyed by governments at any time; or they can try to use their power to become influential in the government, but it’s still the government wielding all the real power. Even in the ultimate kleptocracies, like China or Russia, the government has the real power and controlling the government gets you the wealth.  Neither Putin nor Xi Jinping parlayed existing wealth into power, they gained power through political machinations until they climbed to the top, then they parlayed that into fabulous wealth. The idea that successful wealthy business men are ‘buying governments’ is a bit of fantasy. What actually happens is corrupt governments take over business and markets and loot them for personal gain; that’s the actual origin of oligarchies.",0

His supporters should instead of dismissing the concerns of minorities as “causing division”, or condescending remarks such as “who are they going to vote for trump” (we aren’t even in primary territory yet ffs), put aside their personal feelings and try to listen to their fellow voters concerns, and use that to actively push the campaign to craft a message and policy that addresses them.

So the suspense we have in LoTR for this reason carries over. Instead they sacrificed that for visuals which inevitably aren't as impactful. I personally agree with a lot of what's being said, especially in regards to military placement. It was hard to get a scope of the battlefield because it was shot so poorly. Sometimes the dead seemed like they had pushed further, then they were back to where they were. It was a little all over the place Nd barely felt like an advancement. They were just kind of there all of a sudden.

But even in regards to what you're saying the battle kicks off not making any sense. They know only certain weapons can kill the undead so their main strategy is to send in a suicide troupe? How is the scene with the Dothraki fires going out meant to hold any weight when we knew they were there to kill themselves anyway? They were given no defence whatsoever to fight the undead. Only by chance do they end up with flames to hold themselves but that was never the plan. The plan was ""start with suicide and then we'll hope for the best"". How does that make any sense to you? I mean just think that over. Their first line of defence was to *send a suicide team to an army that raises the dead*. Their first plan was to increase their enemy numbers and decrease their own at the same time.

Then you get other situations like when Jon and Danny are lost in the storm. Jon finds Winterfell but doesn't know how to signal to Dany despite riding a giant torch? Hmmmm okay.

The entire plan relied on flanking the Night King as he goes for Bran but they have a tiny miniscule troupe to protect him? If he's the bait and the secret to winning why would their not be dozens of people with arrows hidden all around the tree waiting to get the jump on NK? That's already their strategy, to let him come to Bran and to stop him on the way.",0

"He’s had his hand forced to play those players in those positions through injury. Just because I’m not a Tottenham fan doesn’t mean I don’t watch the matches lmao, get off of your high horse bud. Your squad is finally coming back healthy with the likes of Sissoko, Jan and possibly Kane back for the return leg, also with Son returning. Poch won’t have to play players out of position, and if I was a betting man I’d say that there is no chance of what you’re suggesting.

Imagine if he starts Rose as a CM when Wanyama, Sissoko, Alli and Eriksen are all fit, coupled with Foyth at rb when Trippier and Rose are fit, and you get trounced (which this Ajax side are easily capable of doing). Poch would look like a fool. In a CL semi final. You just don’t do that at this stage. His hand was forced this match due to the injury to Kane and the suspension of Son.

"&gt; Right now you have a president that is doing everything he said he was going to do which was the reason people voted for him in the first place. 

Most of his supporters voted for him because:

1. His last name isn't Clinton
2. He's not a Democrat
3. He's not black

They would have voted for anyone who met those qualifications. The rest voted for him because they had something to gain from a Republican in the White House.

Whether he's doing what people voted for him to do is a matter of debate, but he's definitely hurting the working-class people who voted for him in order to help the wealthy. He's such a shitty leader that even with all 3 branches of government under GOP control, the only major legislative victory in 2 years was a tax scam passed under the guise of budget reconciliation. A tax scam that is fucking over the middle class working folks who voted for him. Now we're in a trade war that is fucking over the middle class working folks, including the agriculture industry.

"&gt;First, let's recall what that dialog looked like

Ok. The dialogue looked like this:

&gt;""There is no evidence of collusion.""

Simple stuff.

&gt;There was an awful lot of smoke being reported by reputable sources, and there's not a single piece that NYT or WaPo or WSJ reported on the Trump-Rusiia front that Mueller Report disproved.

[You're wrong.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/donald-trump-russia-collusion-cia.html)

[I can do this all day.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/17/yes-there-was-collusion-now-what-will-we-do-about-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d7340256626f)

[There are literally dozens of articles.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/not-true-james-comey-denounces-nyt-report-on-trump-campaign-collusion-with-russia-during-testimony)

(Made sure to use WaPo and NYT articles just for you - there are plenty more, too - just let me know if you need them.)

&gt;So all the stuff that happened that caused us to call for an investigation is shit that *really did happen*.

[You mean a false report that was debunked mid investigation?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

&gt;The softening of the RNC platform, the multiple attempts to establish communication backdoors, the contact between Sessions and Kislayak, and him suibsequently lying about it, a ton of other Trump staffers and Trump himself getting caught lying about contact with Russians - all that was real.

\[Sources please.\]

&gt;What's not real is the characterization that there was ""no collusion"" according to the Mueller report. The accurate characterization is that there wasn't enough admissible evidence to indict for it. Here's what the report has to say on the subject in its opening paragraphs:

That's some hard-core mental gymnastics for a huge nothing burger. Try harder. Your opinion is irrelevant. Meullers isn't. And Meuller said: ""No Evidence of Collusion.""

No matter what you may think constitute evidence... it's irrelevant. Meuller found none and your opinion on the matter is now irrelevant. Thanks for sharing it, though.

&gt;The report proceeds to name Flynn, Papadopolous, Cohen and Manafort as those who got charged.

Are you pretending that these people are guilty of collusion? Because literally none were charged with anything remotely resembling collusion.

&gt;That's not a determination that there was no collusion/coordination/conspiracy. That's ""we investigated the campaign and found enough dirt to indict the campaign manager and his right-hand guy along with Flynn and Papadop. Everyone else covered their tracks well enough that we can't bring a case against them.""

If you investigate a murder and find out that the suspect and his buddies are drug dealers... you arrest them for dealing drugs. But that doesn't mean they're murderers.

In this case: If you investigate collusion and find evidence of Tax Fraud (from years prior and not associated with a ""Russian Collusion"" investigation) you arrest them for their crimes - but that doesn't mean you get to label them as a traitor.

You're trying really hard to make 2+2=5.

&gt;Then of course it's followed by a second half of the report that says ""by the way, here's an open-and-shut case on the president obstructing the everloving shit out of our investigation. Did we mention that's a federal felony? Hey Congress, time for you guys to do your job.""

You must have a gold medal for the Mental Gymnastic Olympics.  Do you know how quotes work? Because that was literally never said. You're paraphrasing with a ridiculous bias. You're painting "" ***The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him***,' as ""he is clearly guilty.""

That is blatantly false. It's about as neutral a statement as one can get (and mine is the actual quote).

Look - it's clear you're chomping at the bit to get Trump with something... but why?

"I’d like to point out something that everyone seems to be skipping. Your daughter’s biological mother is the one who skipped out on Mother’s Day with her child. It’s funny how no one is calling her a cunt or an asshole or saying she’s horrible for not spending Mother’s Day with the child she actually birthed and raised. You don’t even seem upset about that.....but you are angry with your wife, who has only been a step-parent for 3.5 years and only sees your daughters 4 days a month. 

Have you considered that given the length of your marriage and the age of your kids, your daughters likely have never really seen your wife in a motherly role and vice versa? That’s pretty normal. I see it all the time in posts written by step-kids. “I have a mom/dad. I don’t need another one.” “My stepmom is always trying to act like she can tell me what to do.” “My stepdad needs to back off. I don’t need his advice.” Blending families when the kids are preteens and teens doesn’t work like it does when kids are young, especially if Mom or Dad are still fully involved. Parental relationships don’t develop as naturally, if at all. A “fun aunt” or friendly type relation tends to happen in healthy households instead. 

There’s just a lot of information missing from this post. What kind of relationship does your wife have with your daughters? Is she close with them? Has she made overtures? Have they indicated at any time they see her as a mother? Has there been serious tension or bad experiences? Has she been given a motherly role in your daughter’s life? Do you and your ex allow your wife to actually parent? Is she involved in decision making as equally? Would your daughter have wanted to spend Mother’s Day with your wife if her biological mother was available? Has your daughter ever even acknowledged your wife on Mothers day before? 

Depending on the answer to any of those questions, your wife could be being perfectly reasonable or a total asshole. Either way, it’s not particularly fair for you to expect her to “fill-in” because biomom is busy doing something else.",1

"He takes 20+ shots a game at shit efficiency, which means his teammates need to shoot that much better to make up for it and that just isn't going to happen, especially on a team that has a lack of shooting in the first place. If your usage is between 30-40% and you're doing that at below average efficiency, that is just bad new bears for your team's chances. I also think the idea of him getting all those extra rebounds is a complete waste of time and doesn't help them, but that's kind of a side issue more than a main one. And I don't mean to sound like I'm saying he absolutely never will and that's a fact, but he's on the wrong side of 30 now so it isn't looking good for him if he never changes his style. There's also just the precedent. Dude hasn't gotten out of the 1st rd on his own. Why should we think he's good enough to win a ring being the top dog?

All in all, some players I feel just aren't meant to be the best on a team and win a ring and sometimes I can't even explain why. It's usually due to inefficient chucking though, or it's if they're playing a position that is not conducive to winning a championship. What i mean by that is like, centers today being the best on a team probably doesn't bode well for you in terms of winning a ring. Embiid or Jokic is the closest we got right now, and I still think they got time until they see the finals. That being said Jokic is kind of a complete freak in how he plays so who knows with him. Right now the best odds of winning a ring are having your best player be a SF. That is possibly kind of skewed though considering Lebron is the greatest SF of all time and KD is at worst 3rd. It'll be interesting to see what happens once GSW is over with. They kind of change how people perceive the league right now.",0

I’m sure there will also be the same dumbfounded reactions from his supporters as it was in 2016 when he again fails to capture votes from minority demographics. His supporters should instead of dismissing the concerns of minorities as “causing division”, or condescending remarks such as “who are they going to vote for trump” (we aren’t even in primary territory yet ffs), put aside their personal feelings and try to listen to their fellow voters concerns, and use that to actively push the campaign to craft a message and policy that addresses them.

"The sketchiest thing I’ve ever done on the water was going fishing for Humboldt squid out of Cabo. 

For context me and my family have been going to Cabo for about 15 years now and me and my stepdad always go on a charter fishing boat for a couple days when we’re down there, we always go with local guides as he speaks fluent Spanish and doesn’t like going with American captains.

Anyhow about 10 years ago we went out and it was really slow for tuna/yellowtail/amberjack and the stuff we usually go for and our guide talked us into going for Humboldt squid as there were a ton in the area and it’s a unique experience. So we end up going for it. The first eye opener for me was that the spot to catch these suckers was right off downtown Cabo, maybe a few hundred yards away from The Office/Mango Deck and we’d usually fish miles away from the harbor. So we get there and right away start getting lots of bites. We start catching squid after squid after squid and they’re big fuckers, like 5+ feet and they fight hard. One squid we caught ended up trying to “jet” away and ended up squirting water over the whole rear of the boat and got everyone soaked with gross squid water (not ink) and they were generally a real handful to reel in. They also are extremely aggressive, after the first few we caught we started catching squid with other squid eating them so you’re essentially fighting 2-3 squid at a time and they also try and grab you when you pull them out of the water and this combo is extremely dangerous as fisherman have died when they are pulling out a squid that is attached to other squids and then they grab onto the fisherman and pull them over the boat and drown them. There was a few of us so whoever wasn’t reeling was trying to knock off the other squid with gaffes. We ended up catching something like 15-20 of them before calling it a day just because they were so exhausting. All in all it was pretty wild and I feel a little weird swimming in the ocean there.",0

In Military, cover me is used for suppressing fire. It is typically used in cases where a solider have to move through a dangerous position to do a task where they could easily get hit by enemy forces. Example: Soldiers moving to higher ground or retrieving wounded soldiers from the zone. Suppressing fire in these cases prevents the enemy from popping out and shooting at you. 

Police use cover me as a prompt for their fellow officers to look out of threats against the officer who said cover me. This is mostly used in cases where an office is moving into a position where they would be vulnerable. Example: An officer investigating an abandoned vehicle. Or trying to knock the door of a house where a dangerous person lives.",0

"I wasn’t saying that dragons in and of themselves existing is the unbelievable thing. Dragons should not exist because they’d collapse under their own weight. It has nothing to do with magic, that’s just science and logic. Same thing with a skeleton hand punching through solid rock. It’s all the same rules of reality that govern gravity, survivability in combat, and the relatively sharpness of weaponry. If those things are okay, then so should someone managing to disentangle themselves from a swarm with the use of their one-shot zombie lightsabers and the aid of close-by allies. Otherwise, you’re utilizing *selective suspension,* where something’s that break reality and logic and somethings aren’t just because you wanted to see some more dead main characters. 

That’s my thing. The more I hear people saying it’s a matter of believability and physics and whatever, the more it just doesn’t add up because if you actually cared about these characters and their struggles and stories and lives, then the fact they did survive despite these insurmountable odds should be joyous. Instead it seems like it matters more that fucking Isaac Newton’s math homework should be respected and just *bitch, bitch, bitch.* If you like these people and this story, then why it is such a big deal? Why the endless debates? Especially when there’s not been a precedent for major characters dying in battle, and statistically speaking, that’s when a main character is the safest. Name me a main character or major supporting character who has died in the thick of battle like everyone seemed to expect this episode. There was Ygritte. That’s the only one who comes to my mind.

I understand it’s an issue, maybe they should have shot those scenes to be less dogpile-y or Arya’s leap should be shorter or whatever else, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad writing or a bad story. It’s bad math and bad physics, but math and physics and even *logic herself* are not the rulers of Story-Town. They can advise on some things, but they do not make the final call. Even in Game of Thrones, they’ve never made the final call. And if that’s your primary concern when it comes to stories, then maybe you need to re-examine your priories.",1

He also didn’t indict any of Trump’s family members, several of whom looked very much guilty of similar crimes to his, nor did he call Trump in for a formal interview, instead repeatedly asking him and allowing him the opportunity to refuse.

The doc I was working with heard this and told me to take an early lunch break so I sat with her until she passed. It wasn’t long. She made mistakes, had been an addict, got HIV, and didn’t take care of herself. None of that matters. She was alone and I was there, a wannabe doctor shadowing a real doctor. She was DNR and she was given painkillers (dying of a bunch of things hurts). She drifted to sleep and the monitor showed a slowing heart rate.

Two (several years and degrees later):
A man was flown to our hospital for an evolving aortic dissection (the aorta was tearing and starting to leak blood into his chest). The attending physician was getting ready to intubate him and the man was moaning. He kept saying “my back. My back is being ripped open. Ripped.”
The doctor leaned over the bed put a hand on the man’s chest and said “I’m sorry you hurt. You know you are very, very sick, right?” The man nodded and said “yes, doc”. He then went back to talking about the ripping sensation while the paralytic a general anaesthetic drug were pushed. Intubation began but the man suddenly became pulseless and CPR was started. He was pronounced dead a few minutes later. Looking at the CT scans from the hospital that flew him to us, the man should have been dead before the helicopter took off. 
He had a type A dissection that was leaking blood from the false lumen into his chest. http://emdidactic.blogspot.com/2018/01/acute-aortic-syndromes.html?m=1",0

"**Welcome  to part 3 of the coverage of the XFL. Before we start, I wanna state for the record I don’t necessarily agree with everything said here. As a mod for XFL subreddit, I want to see the league succeed. With that being said, let’s begin.**

**When we last left off, the XFL was still in development. Now, we’re in week 2. And already, we’re seeing signs of issues. First, here are a compilation of quotes from people in the wrestling business, some taken from the McMahon DVD and others being from miscellaneous. This is part 3 of a 5 part series I’m doing. Part 4 will cover Jesse Ventura’s friend (We’ll reveal who when we get there) and part 5 will cover the XFL’s close and also showcase the oral history SB Nation did on the XFL. Enjoy.**

Ivory: We were just pissed. We were pissed. I kept always saying ""I just wanna meet the guy who’s jersey and helmet came out of my paycheck"". You know, we try not to talk about money too much in our car rides but we decided, one car ride— I remember it was with Bob Holly and some other people— we decided that, across the board, all of our royalties had gone down by 10%. So, we were like ""Hmm…"" So, these damn guys better be doing it right because they’re running around on our cash. Our livelihoods.

Joey Styles: The first thing you saw when the first XFL game came on the air on a Saturday night on NBC was The Rock. It wasn’t about football at that point. The next thing I saw was Vince McMahon, himself, in an XFL jacket walking to midfield with his over-the-top Mr. McMahon voice saying

(Clip of Vince McMahon saying ""This is the XFL"" plays)

Joey Styles: And I think what happened was by not letting the XFL live on its own without any WWE personalities, all of the WWE hating media, right or wrong, jumped on the XFL. and if that didn’t do it, the cheerleaders surely did, because there was sure as hell a big difference between traditional football cheerleaders and the strippers that were cheerleading for the XFL grinding in those outfits.

Eric Bischoff: Had the XFL been a 3 year plan or a 5 year plan, I think it would probably be around today. It would’ve changed the sports industry as we know it.

Bob Costas: I think it should have been as obvious as steering clear of a dark alley in a dangerous neighborhood. Everything about it screamed to me schlock and crap. Everything that subsequently occurred validated that impression. In fairness, Dick Ebersol never asked me. None of the announcers who were associated with NBC were going to be used on this experiment, so there was never any danger of that.

Bruce Prichard: This is developed on the private jet on the way to the first game. On a Wednesday before the first game. We start talking about what we used to do as kids. We used to put a football in the middle of the street and line up at opposite ends and whoever got the football first started with it. It was street football, that’s how we played street football. ""I love it"", Vince said.

It wasn’t discussed with any football people, not discussed with any coaches or players or any input from the football experts — It’s Michael Hayes, Bruce Prichard, Brian Gerwitz, Stephanie McMahon, Vince McMahon, and Dick Ebersol. So we were like, ""What do we call that""? I think Michael Hayes came up with the name ""Scramble"".

**Also, before the XFL premiered, they shot a bunch of promos highlighting the cheerleaders. There was only one problem: they were all dancers. They touted the cheerleaders as having day jobs like one being a doctor and one being a teacher except they were all dancers. Here’s what Bruce Prichard said about that.**

Bruce Prichard: So, I end the meeting kind of abruptly and I grabbed this lady and I said ""What the fuck""? I can make shit work, but now I’ve got to go back and explain to Vince that I got a chick that likes to read math books, I got a chick that works at a lawyer office, a chick that used to work at a doctor’s office or a chick that wanted to be a lawyer and um…

Conrad: Two dozen dancers.

Bruce Prichard: They’re all dancers! And I said ""What the fuck?"" ""Well, tomorrow will be a better group"". ""I’ve got to shoot shit today!""

Conrad: Yeah

Bruce Prichard: So, essentially, I just made shit up.

(Conrad laughs hard)

Bruce Prichard: I took the bitch that worked at a lawyer’s office, I put her in a lawyer’s office, man. I had her be a lawyer.

Conrad: Coming in hot with that language.

Bruce Prichard: I had the one— oh, this is another good one. This was one, we’ve got a sport trainer or something like that. So, I go talk to her. She dateda trainer in high school. I said ""Well, great. You’re gonna be my athletic trainer"". I took the chick that liked to read math books— now, get this: she liked to read math books but she hated math and she couldn’t do any math problems. So, I had to have her go bring me one of those math books and we just did a complicated math problem on the wall. And here’s my favorite part of all. When we divvied up crews and everything, I said ""You know what? I’ll take these girls, Michael, you and Brian, you go take these girls, and you take your crew and I’ll do my crew"". Well, I made it so that my crew and all my girls, I could shoot everything right there at the stadium. I just did backstage stuff and I made a training room, I made a classroom, I just made shit up there. And Stephanie McMahon stayed with me and helped me produce and Michael and them were up until the wee hours of the morning having to shoot stuff on location in Las Vegas. It SUCKKKKKKED. Because they were just local dancers.",1

""A 46,XY mother who developed as a normal woman underwent spontaneous puberty, reached menarche, menstruated regularly, experienced two unassisted pregnancies, and gave birth to a 46,XY daughter with complete gonadal dysgenesis...

Herein we report the extraordinary case of *a fertile woman* with normal ovaries and a *predominantly 46,XY ovarian karyotype*, who gave birth to a 46,XY female with complete gonadal dysgenesis. The karyotype of this phenotypically normal mother was 46,XY in blood, 80% 46,XY and 20% 45,X in cultured skin fibroblasts, and 93% 46,XY, 6% 45,X, and &lt;1% 46,XX in the ovary. The family pedigree on the mother’s side was notable for the presence of seven individuals over four generations with either sexual ambiguity, infertility, or failure to menstruate, including one individual with documented 45,X/45,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Both the mother and the 46,XY daughter were screened for mutations in a number of genes known to be involved in mammalian testis determination. In all genes screened (see below), the open reading frame was found to be normal. This suggests that a mutation in a novel sex-determination gene or a gene that predisposes to chromosomal mosaicism may be responsible for the phenotype in this family...

Maternity testing was performed by using the short tandem repeat kit AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nine short tandem repeats were analyzed (D3S1358, VWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) using thermal cycling conditions, capillary electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and products were analyzed using the ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis instrument and GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems).""

Snoke was killed by his own hubris, and as interesting as he was, he was unimportant. And the light speed thing does make me skeptical - why haven't we seen that before?

As for Arya sneaking up, she is kinda a well-established super assassin and we see that the undead aren't perfect detectors of humans by any means. And even then she is stopped by him and only succeeds because of fancy knife work.

The point of the storyline was to establish good from bad, give cersei a chance at redemption to make her a truly evil character, knock Khaleesi down a notch so she didn't have unstoppable forces,  and bring all our favorite characters back together to stand against the night.

It was far from perfect but it served those purposes and sets us up for getting back to the actual game of thrones. I just wish so many main characters hadn't been shown on the brink of death a dozen times then saved by plot armor. Really felt very un-GRRM-like.",1

What is that reason? Some would argue that it is because the are people who believe that youth under 18 shouldn't know anything about sex or sexuality. They may also consider such places to be perverse.

&gt;...isn't being overly sexual a sign of being sexually abused? Like ya kids start exploring at that age but I feel sex toys pushes it a bit too far.

Not really. It needs to be considered within an environmental context. The child is likely learning about sex in school and is curious. This is a sensitive period, and not a good time to shame them (if there is one).

&gt;Also if a 6th grader told her teacher or someone she trusted that her parents were buying her sex toys, CPS would be getting involved.

There may be questions since it isn't the norm. A social worker would want to determine the circumstances of the matter, but there wouldn't be an apprehension for allowing a child to explore their sexual development in a healthy way.",1

"Feminism *is* about hating men tho, the fact that they are factually correct is not really relevant. Just like how white supremacist can say that black women lead the nation in obesity and STD rates. It may be factually true, but their *objective* is to spread race based hatred. The same is true here, men obviously are more aggressive and are more violent, but femanazis only use that truth in their efforts to spread hatred and fear.

""Hate Facts"" as they are known are always a ""carriage in front of the horse"" type of deal. You have to look at what a persons agenda is when you are analyzing their argument.

"It’s true. Businesses have pervaded the election process. 

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0

* It's still speculation but there are a lot of dot's that fit together to support this claim (Subtitles not showing or generic for \[Yelling\] (Because they don't want Viewers to know Arya is there yet for Cinematography purposes so they don't ruin the surprise when she shanks the night king)

&amp;#x200B;

* Miguel Sapochnik saying he broke the rules of game of thrones for the Night King scene where he slowed down time to make events move faster and slower in certain areas for dramatic affect.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Sound Jon makes sounds like ""GOOO"" ""GO"" ""GO"" and we see his camera angle he is looking towards the Camera he could be seeing somebody

&amp;#x200B;

* Arya is known to run really fast and is very agile the scene with the White walkers hair blowing in the wind supports in a way that she was running past him right towards the Night King.

&amp;#x200B;

* It makes the Scene come together beautifully because Jon put his Trust in his sister to Defend Bran. (Not to mention the hard symbolism for there being ""No One"" at the end to defend Bran (No one being Arya).

&amp;#x200B;

* The Entrance the Dragon landed on was the Entrance to the Godswood. The Dragon was blocking the Entrance to enter the Godswood for Jon. Jon Distracting the Dragon Long enough for Arya to stealth or Run past makes sense.

but I digress

retail is absolutely physically exploitative. good friend of mine needed a full knee replacement as a teenager bc the stepladder broke underneath them while retrieving 50 pound bags of cat litter from the top shelf (those bags aren't stackable so management liked to have them up top). management didn't pay a cent cause they had provided a too-short stepladder, forcing them to use that top step that's ""not a step."" that way, when it DID break, they could say the worker knowingly did something unsafe &amp; is responsible. she continued to work there &amp; in fact works there to this day bc she got kicked out for being gay, so no choice. she interviewed other places but the management of her current job told them all she sued them for workman's comp so none of them would hire her. oh, and her pay got docked. she picked up another 2 very similar, very low-paying jobs to make up for it.

another friend from further back, somewhere around 12, was working under the table for an uncle who wanted her at the shop doors at 4am so she could get things ready for him to open before she went to school every day &amp; then close for him every night. she took drugs to counter the sleep deprivation &amp; walked to the store alone, in the dark. her parents were abusive &amp; made her pay rent, so she couldn't quit.

The point of the storyline was to establish good from bad, give cersei a chance at redemption to make her a truly evil character, knock Khaleesi down a notch so she didn't have unstoppable forces,  and bring all our favorite characters back together to stand against the night.

""A 46,XY mother who developed as a normal woman underwent spontaneous puberty, reached menarche, menstruated regularly, experienced two unassisted pregnancies, and gave birth to a 46,XY daughter with complete gonadal dysgenesis...

Herein we report the extraordinary case of *a fertile woman* with normal ovaries and a *predominantly 46,XY ovarian karyotype*, who gave birth to a 46,XY female with complete gonadal dysgenesis. The karyotype of this phenotypically normal mother was 46,XY in blood, 80% 46,XY and 20% 45,X in cultured skin fibroblasts, and 93% 46,XY, 6% 45,X, and &lt;1% 46,XX in the ovary. The family pedigree on the mother’s side was notable for the presence of seven individuals over four generations with either sexual ambiguity, infertility, or failure to menstruate, including one individual with documented 45,X/45,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Both the mother and the 46,XY daughter were screened for mutations in a number of genes known to be involved in mammalian testis determination. In all genes screened (see below), the open reading frame was found to be normal. This suggests that a mutation in a novel sex-determination gene or a gene that predisposes to chromosomal mosaicism may be responsible for the phenotype in this family...

Maternity testing was performed by using the short tandem repeat kit AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

"She said she withheld sex when she didn’t get what she wanted, like fancy date nights and gifts. That’s a form of withholding affection, but equating it to sex work is a major stretch when we’re talking about a monogamous relationship. Theoretically, a very spoiled and old fashioned housewife could be considered a whore, even if she’s literally only had sex with her husband. That doesn’t seem just a *little* weird?

And it’s funny how we’re also putting the onus of judgment on the “whore” and not the man that tolerated her behavior enough to remain in a relationship with her. I wonder why OP didn’t call his friend a pathetic john if he *legitimately* thinks his lady is a whore.

Because the anime industry doesn't believe that people would buy their products for a fair price.

That is how they balance for people who don't buy the anime and instead pirate it.

This is a shitty excuse for theft.

They had to calculate because you didn't care for their hard work enough to pay them.

And yes ofc I pirated anime too, it is almost impossible to get every anime and sometimes the industry can be really shitty like not upgrading to Blue Ray Release. At least I try to buy to support them.

* It's still speculation but there are a lot of dot's that fit together to support this claim (Subtitles not showing or generic for \[Yelling\] (Because they don't want Viewers to know Arya is there yet for Cinematography purposes so they don't ruin the surprise when she shanks the night king)

&amp;#x200B;

* Miguel Sapochnik saying he broke the rules of game of thrones for the Night King scene where he slowed down time to make events move faster and slower in certain areas for dramatic affect.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Sound Jon makes sounds like ""GOOO"" ""GO"" ""GO"" and we see his camera angle he is looking towards the Camera he could be seeing somebody

&amp;#x200B;

* Arya is known to run really fast and is very agile the scene with the White walkers hair blowing in the wind supports in a way that she was running past him right towards the Night King.

&amp;#x200B;

* It makes the Scene come together beautifully because Jon put his Trust in his sister to Defend Bran. (Not to mention the hard symbolism for there being ""No One"" at the end to defend Bran (No one being Arya).

&amp;#x200B;

* The Entrance the Dragon landed on was the Entrance to the Godswood. The Dragon was blocking the Entrance to enter the Godswood for Jon. Jon Distracting the Dragon Long enough for Arya to stealth or Run past makes sense.

Then, now that he said what he had to say to win his presidency, he is explicitly anti-lgbt: his administration is attempting to remove civil rights protections for trans people, trans people are not allowed to join the military and many are being forced out, and he appointed Kavanaugh, who is very unlikely to work towards LGBT rights on any supreme court case based on his history and what little he's said on the subject.",1
"That's more to do with the rise of the Internet than anything else. We were and still predominantly are an online-focused community/subculture.

There are tons of ""greymuzzles"" in the fandom who grew up with stuff like Disney's Robin Hood or the Animalympics or other old media like that as their major influences.

Which isn't to say Lola Bunny is undeserving of credit for being the furry ""awakening"" for a number of people...but I've found that there seem to be more people *outside* the fandom who are drawn by her sex appeal than within. Could be due to the number of other sources we have though and some kind of lower threshold weirdos like us have when it comes to being drawn to anthropomorphic characters (for instance I find Lola hot, sure, but she's no Maid Marian/Robin Hood or Renamon or Krystal or Braixen or okay maybe I just have a thing for foxes...).

"&gt;Why the hell you sending cavalry in by itself

Dothraki are a field army. As Robert said ""[only a fool would fight the Dothraki on an open field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OitYP2MTYMg)""

&amp;#x200B;

Also relevant cavalry charge from Lord of the rings

[https://youtu.be/EmTz7EAYLrs?t=274](https://youtu.be/EmTz7EAYLrs?t=274) 

Only reason people are complaining is because it was unsuccessful

&gt;having the riders carve the flanks to bits like a common fucking battle tactic.

There is no position advantage when fighting wights. Rear, front, sides its all the same.

&gt;Staying inside the keep and making it a battle of attrition you can win?

Battle of attrition against an undead army.  That doesn't eat, sleep, get tired, have emotion and can create another army of undead on the spot. Attrition is not something living people can do against the undead

I mean come on they instantly lost the walls, and even with the cavalry charge, two dragons clearing the open field, defense of the wall and courtyard the wights still made it to theon

&gt;Why not use the dragons to carve a path for the dothraki to charge into?

Clear a path to what exactly? A commander thats nowhere to be seen? Only thing you are doing is allowing whatever forces you cleared a path for to be more easily surrounded",1

"I’m almost certain the 12 year old girl wasn’t buying a dildo but rather a clitoral vibrator. Young girls typically use small clitoral vibrators and I’m certain that’s what this girl’s mom agreed to buy her... these vibrators also have no resemblance of a penis either... so is that okay then? 

Additional, it seems you’re under the assumption that all women/young girls can orgasm with just their hands, which is absolutely untrue. Nearly 50% of women need a vibrator to orgasm during masturbation and 5% of women will never orgasm once in their lifetime. So you’re theory that a girl using a vibrator means she’s advancing to something more serious than strictly manual masturbation is flawed, because for a lot of women, including myself, the first time they ever masturbating is with a clitoral vibrator due to their inability to orgasm or even come close to orgasm without it. 

Your last comment is confusing... are you saying it’s okay for a 12 year old to have a vibrator or pocket pussy as long as they sneak around their parents back? It seems you’re making the argument that the reason it was wrong for you to have one at 12 was because it would have made your dad uncomfortable, not because there’s anything wrong with having one?",1

"&gt;Eriksen has been poor for months not just for every couple of games imao. 

Eriksen has been overworked and forced to take on his normal attacking responsibilities in addition to covering for the complete lack of midfield, and during that time he's still managed to be the side's chief creative force and the hub of every period of dominance or positive play.

&gt;And Dele has been steadily regressing as a player for years and has had a really poor season too so far. How many goals has he scored this year? 4? 5? How many chances has created for other players? Did you even watch yesterday's game? Both have been very sub par.

Saying Dele's regressed is just nonsense. Last season was his best, most influential for Spurs yet. He's scoring less because he's simply playing a completely different role - he used to play directly off of Kane, he's been gradually moving deeper into a more conventional attacking midfield role and this season sometimes as an outright central midfielder. He started this season excellently, and until he started picking up niggling injuries he was playing some of his best ever football and was arguably the side's strongest performer. And same as Eriksen, the side just looks infinitely better when he's playing. You keep bringing up yesterday... Neither was bad at all, and when Sissoko came on to shore up the midfield their influence started growing and growing.

&gt;And do you know how hard is it to find versatile players like him who can play in 3-4 different positions? Just because he's plays better in the final third it doesn't mean he's a limited player imao. Imagine Eriksen playing as the focal point of attack. Or Dele. Do you think they will do just as a good job as him? They have different roles within the team, sure but that doesn't mean that somehow Dele and Eriksen are more well rounded players than Son.

Dele has played for Spurs in a double pivot, a midfield 3, as a 10, as a second striker, in a front 3... He's aerially strong in both boxes, he offers a passing outlet to the centre backs, he carries the ball from deep... How can you even suggest Son is as well rounded as him? That is nonsense.  Could Son play next to Wanyama like both these guys have done? Could he be the side's playmaker?


&gt;defensively?? That's why he played as a second right back and left back switching sides in the City game???

No? I don't at all. But I never even said Son doesn't contribute defensively, you've conjured that. He's simply not as effective as the other 2, covers less distance, has less physical presence...",1

It was my first year with a job and I was proud to spend money I'd saved and earned on my family. I mentioned getting a new one latter that day and he told me not to bother. He had already bought a new motorized set. I don't think he realized that it hurt my feelings. It took him less than two weeks to replace my Christmas gift. 

I wish I had an answer as to help you, but I don't. Involving him in getting getting gifts is a good idea. Maybe you go to the store together or maybe you let him know what you want to get him and ask him to do some looking online. Don't forget to treat yourself sometimes too. 

Some people don't value gifts as gifts but things. Things to be replaced or upgraded. There's no sentimental value. It's probably been mentioned by others here but I'd check out the love languages. It does a pretty good job of explaining that.

Both can dock without assistance, but if something goes wrong, they've got less ability to recover themselves versus the Shuttle.",0

"Idk, on my comment thread here the general consensus is that the guy had some kind of reasonable statement in that he is probably too young and too immature/not ready for a child. Also that it is a 2 way street, contraception was obviously unused, this was not a planned child. 

I believe people should only have children if they want children and want to take care of them, nurture them and help them grow into decent people, too often these days people just get pregnant from having, frankly, lazily unprotected sex. That being said, there’s nothing stopping a single parent from absolutely smashing it and producing a well balanced human being.

I think society as a whole is actually maturing, people have become generally more accepting of other races, gender equality is on the rise, and more people than ever can freely express their chosen sexuality, but we still have a long way to go before any of those things are at the level of acceptance they should be.

"That's absolutely incorrect;

""A 46,XY mother who developed as a normal woman underwent spontaneous puberty, reached menarche, menstruated regularly, experienced two unassisted pregnancies, and gave birth to a 46,XY daughter with complete gonadal dysgenesis...

Herein we report the extraordinary case of *a fertile woman* with normal ovaries and a *predominantly 46,XY ovarian karyotype*, who gave birth to a 46,XY female with complete gonadal dysgenesis. The karyotype of this phenotypically normal mother was 46,XY in blood, 80% 46,XY and 20% 45,X in cultured skin fibroblasts, and 93% 46,XY, 6% 45,X, and &lt;1% 46,XX in the ovary. The family pedigree on the mother’s side was notable for the presence of seven individuals over four generations with either sexual ambiguity, infertility, or failure to menstruate, including one individual with documented 45,X/45,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Both the mother and the 46,XY daughter were screened for mutations in a number of genes known to be involved in mammalian testis determination. In all genes screened (see below), the open reading frame was found to be normal. This suggests that a mutation in a novel sex-determination gene or a gene that predisposes to chromosomal mosaicism may be responsible for the phenotype in this family...

Maternity testing was performed by using the short tandem repeat kit AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nine short tandem repeats were analyzed (D3S1358, VWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) using thermal cycling conditions, capillary electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and products were analyzed using the ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis instrument and GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems).""

Politically, this is just to get ammunition for the election.

And putting partisanship aside for a moment, I honestly would find it pretty angering if Barr could just spin the report without at least being publicly embarrassed by the lead author of the report, so I think it’s generally good accountability.

"First question: I don’t think we know. Maybe they had dragonglass and ahraks but once the ahraks are on fire they just kept them. If this still bothers you the episode provides no answer. 

2,3,4 : the answer, in story, is that the characters are bad at tactics. I’m apparently a unicorn because I liked the episode, but I don’t actually have an excuse. Out of the story the answer is: to look cool.

5: ghost is alive, the episode didn’t tell us that, though, he was in the preview. 

6: it’s not the time, it’s the middle of a battle.

7: because the options are to use the dragons and maybe die or not use them and definitely die. 

8: to draw out the NK. that’s actually explained.

As an outsider it's insane to watch you Americans talk about everything else but the guns. Yes mental health is an issue, an even bigger issue is the rampant bullying and mean evil culture young people deem acceptable so long as violence isn't used.


You guys need a complete ban on semi Auto weapon and a huge change more like Australia or England to all firearms. 

Yes if someone wants to kill they use other methods but ease of availability and ease of use put guns at number one. I would bet my life the amount of mass murders that have happened in the last decade would be a drastically lower number if ten years ago these changes were strictly implemented. There is no denying this. Yes the black market exists but your average bullied loner, scorned lover or extreme ideolog doesn't hang with criminals and can't usually get an assault rifle from them.


You guys need to wake up and realise that second amendment was written during a completely different era of humanity to cover a completely different challenge and everyone just loves their guns so much they hide behind it. The rest of the world watches on with disgust.",1

"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically. 

Peoples misconception of the arcs and mixing that with theories they’ve heard and prophecies they’ve taken either literally or misinterpreted is the problem here more than bad writing",1

"I said the same thing in my Foreshadowing/Symbolism/Callback post i tried to gather as much information as i could about Episode 3.

&amp;#x200B;

* It's still speculation but there are a lot of dot's that fit together to support this claim (Subtitles not showing or generic for \[Yelling\] (Because they don't want Viewers to know Arya is there yet for Cinematography purposes so they don't ruin the surprise when she shanks the night king)

&amp;#x200B;

* Miguel Sapochnik saying he broke the rules of game of thrones for the Night King scene where he slowed down time to make events move faster and slower in certain areas for dramatic affect.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Sound Jon makes sounds like ""GOOO"" ""GO"" ""GO"" and we see his camera angle he is looking towards the Camera he could be seeing somebody

&amp;#x200B;

* Arya is known to run really fast and is very agile the scene with the White walkers hair blowing in the wind supports in a way that she was running past him right towards the Night King.

&amp;#x200B;

* It makes the Scene come together beautifully because Jon put his Trust in his sister to Defend Bran. (Not to mention the hard symbolism for there being ""No One"" at the end to defend Bran (No one being Arya).

&amp;#x200B;

* The Entrance the Dragon landed on was the Entrance to the Godswood. The Dragon was blocking the Entrance to enter the Godswood for Jon. Jon Distracting the Dragon Long enough for Arya to stealth or Run past makes sense.

I think people should realize that any attempt to define what constitutes as a religion and what doesn't is by necessity going to Eurocentric because until recently it's not been a universal concept. Personally, I think any good religion should also be a sound philosophical system for understanding reality apart from supernatural elements. In a way philosophical system with rituals could be viewed as religious, which is why Confucianism is often categorized as a religion despite a total lack of ""theology"" or ""god stuff"".",0

"&gt;Eriksen has been poor for months not just for every couple of games imao. 

Eriksen has been overworked and forced to take on his normal attacking responsibilities in addition to covering for the complete lack of midfield, and during that time he's still managed to be the side's chief creative force and the hub of every period of dominance or positive play.

&gt;And Dele has been steadily regressing as a player for years and has had a really poor season too so far. How many goals has he scored this year? 4? 5? How many chances has created for other players? Did you even watch yesterday's game? Both have been very sub par.

Saying Dele's regressed is just nonsense. Last season was his best, most influential for Spurs yet. He's scoring less because he's simply playing a completely different role - he used to play directly off of Kane, he's been gradually moving deeper into a more conventional attacking midfield role and this season sometimes as an outright central midfielder. He started this season excellently, and until he started picking up niggling injuries he was playing some of his best ever football and was arguably the side's strongest performer. And same as Eriksen, the side just looks infinitely better when he's playing. You keep bringing up yesterday... Neither was bad at all, and when Sissoko came on to shore up the midfield their influence started growing and growing.

&gt;And do you know how hard is it to find versatile players like him who can play in 3-4 different positions? Just because he's plays better in the final third it doesn't mean he's a limited player imao. Imagine Eriksen playing as the focal point of attack. Or Dele. Do you think they will do just as a good job as him? They have different roles within the team, sure but that doesn't mean that somehow Dele and Eriksen are more well rounded players than Son.

Dele has played for Spurs in a double pivot, a midfield 3, as a 10, as a second striker, in a front 3... He's aerially strong in both boxes, he offers a passing outlet to the centre backs, he carries the ball from deep... How can you even suggest Son is as well rounded as him? That is nonsense.  Could Son play next to Wanyama like both these guys have done? Could he be the side's playmaker?


&gt;defensively?? That's why he played as a second right back and left back switching sides in the City game???

No? I don't at all. But I never even said Son doesn't contribute defensively, you've conjured that. He's simply not as effective as the other 2, covers less distance, has less physical presence...",1

"The thing about coming into a class late is that is a disruption. Even if you’re doing it quietly as possible, unless it’s a huge university course held in an auditorium style room, people are going to be disrupted by your entering late. It’s 15-20 min into the class, lecture is going full swing, everyone is trying their hardest to keep up writing down what the teacher is saying. Someone enters the classroom late, the door opens, they come in and have to put down all their stuff and take their seat. To some, that is just a quick distraction. Just a quick glance up to the door, acknowledging someone came in late, and then going back to what you’re doing. But not everyone can do that. To the student in class who’s suffering with severe ADHD, you’ve probably cost them the rest of that lecture, because they’ve lost their focus and all they can think about now is the sounds going on, why you’re late, why they’ve been late in the past, and then it’s just a rabbit hole of unrelated thoughts. Not to mention that it’s going to throw off the teacher and cause them to lose focus 

And to be honest, a large part of it is fairness. Everyone else made the decisions and the planning to be able to get there on time. They committed to coming to class on time so they won’t be causing a disruption for their fellow students and their teacher. 

And lastly it’s just rude. Being late is rude. It shows you didn’t care enough about the event to make it a priority to be there on time. It shows the teacher you don’t value their time or the information they are providing you. And it shows your peers that you believe the rules don’t have to apply to you. I personally always admired the teachers who would close their door after class began and wouldn’t open it after, regardless if someone shows up late. If you’re not going to commit to it and be there for the whole thing, you shouldn’t be there at all. You signed up for a class at this specific time. And that’s the only time you should be able to collect it. If you took that 8AM class, but hate waking up early and often show up late, just know that there was probably someone who wanted that time slot, who needed it to be able to work, or have time with their family, who would have shown up on time every day, and wasn’t able to take the class at that time  because there weren’t any seats left. Your being late may not effect everyone in that classroom, but it will effect some, and it could mean that you’re taking an opportunity from someone else who would love to have it and are then wasting part of it.",0

Bran isn’t even Bran anymore, he’s the 3ER, he isn’t supposed to be working a ton with the rest of the characters because he’s bigger than they are. They are in the present, 3ER is the past, present and future. Hes on a different timescale than they are. He came up with the plan to kill NK because that was life and death for Westeros. He told them what they needed to do when it was most important, and provided Arya with the tools to do so. People just don’t understand his character bc they aren’t fed tons of writing to concretely explain 3ER",0

"I agree that no weapon, shield, or formation is going to hold back the wave of the dead, but that isn't to say they couldn't have done *better* than they did. While you're right that the force of a body hurling itself into someone isn't changed via a bigger shield, the *distribution* of that force is.

Without a proper defense, their lines are destroyed, which isolates combatants and allows them to be overrun that much easier, because now they're surrounded and dogpiled. A better shield wall would have reduced that, regardless if they were still going to be overrun eventually or not.

I'm not trying to say that they would have turned the tide and won the battle, but they could have better maintained their defenses and probably allowed more of their number to retreat back into the (relative) safety of the walls. If they'd *also* combined better tactics with better strategic devices (the aforementioned trenches, siege weapons, and so on), they could have fared considerably better. Why they decided to place the only choke point *behind their own lines* is beyond me and makes about as much sense as putting the catapults in front of their infantry.",0

Which is what I meant by the ""or ends up destroying the agency of the character"" bit. If you go with that closed-loop interpretation of the time travel, then Bran becomes a wind-up toy following a preordained path. He can't in any real sense make decisions about what to do, at least not when reaching into the past.  


I think time travel sucks as a plot device in any serious story except where it's the main conceit. It always ends up either being unsatisfying or creating plot holes you could drive a truck through.

Poch won’t have to play players out of position, and if I was a betting man I’d say that there is no chance of what you’re suggesting.

Imagine if he starts Rose as a CM when Wanyama, Sissoko, Alli and Eriksen are all fit, coupled with Foyth at rb when Trippier and Rose are fit, and you get trounced (which this Ajax side are easily capable of doing). Poch would look like a fool. In a CL semi final. You just don’t do that at this stage. His hand was forced this match due to the injury to Kane and the suspension of Son.

Its weird because helms deep is great for the same reasons battle for Winterfell is bad because of the types of shows, helms deep does an amazing arc and makes everyone feel badass and humorous with the stupid ass kill count, and its amazing, while simultaneously winterfell sucked because everybody was badass and invulnerable.

"That's absolutely incorrect;

""A 46,XY mother who developed as a normal woman underwent spontaneous puberty, reached menarche, menstruated regularly, experienced two unassisted pregnancies, and gave birth to a 46,XY daughter with complete gonadal dysgenesis...

Herein we report the extraordinary case of *a fertile woman* with normal ovaries and a *predominantly 46,XY ovarian karyotype*, who gave birth to a 46,XY female with complete gonadal dysgenesis. The karyotype of this phenotypically normal mother was 46,XY in blood, 80% 46,XY and 20% 45,X in cultured skin fibroblasts, and 93% 46,XY, 6% 45,X, and &lt;1% 46,XX in the ovary. The family pedigree on the mother’s side was notable for the presence of seven individuals over four generations with either sexual ambiguity, infertility, or failure to menstruate, including one individual with documented 45,X/45,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Both the mother and the 46,XY daughter were screened for mutations in a number of genes known to be involved in mammalian testis determination. In all genes screened (see below), the open reading frame was found to be normal. This suggests that a mutation in a novel sex-determination gene or a gene that predisposes to chromosomal mosaicism may be responsible for the phenotype in this family...

Maternity testing was performed by using the short tandem repeat kit AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nine short tandem repeats were analyzed (D3S1358, VWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) using thermal cycling conditions, capillary electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and products were analyzed using the ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis instrument and GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems).""

But when someone says ""I am glad he is dead"" it is basically saying that this is the best possible outcome? Is that really the case?

I feel the appropriate response to this should be ""it's unfortunate that she had to kill someone but I am glad she was able to defend her property. Not ""I am glad he is dead.""",1

We've had absolutely nothing on the scale of the sorts of attacks frequently happening in America. Its really not that complicated.

Sure, theres still illegal guns floating around the country, and they'll never get every single gun off the streets, but for the most part all we hear of here in Kangarooville are drug dealers being caught with the odd gun here and there.

"Agreed, in both Infinity War and Endgame, Earth was ground zero for conflicts that would decide the fate of the universe :/ Her presence in the Battle of Wakanda would've prevented the need to even have to check on other planets losing 50% of their population, and who's to say what would've happened if she took her sweet time arriving on Earth while Thanos' warship was pummeling the Avengers? There's no ""other planets"" to protect if Thanos manages to snap away the entire universe out of existence.  
  
Cpt. Marvel being left out of the story to give the OG Avengers time to shine is all good, but there definitely could've been better ways to have her not take away the spotlight without coming off as being ""I'm too good to bother with one planet (not to mention the planet she originally came from)"". Nothing that can't be rectified with some content, like maybe a future movie/novel/comic detailing what kept her occupied enough to keep her eyes away from the crux of the Infinity stone conflict, but as it stands right now she certainly did not make very good decisions if her priority was saving as many planets as she could, given Earth's propensity for being the center of Universe ending conflicts in the MCU.",1

"&gt;  you aren't helping bring anyone to your side of the argument with that kind of comment.

Who says they were trying to? Their point is that anyone who still claims that everyone having guns would result in fewer gun deaths instead of more is too far gone.

American media has convinced people that guns make them safe, as though they're going to quickdraw and ""take down"" the shooter with their superior skills before they can do damage.

"NTA

My Mother was/is a hoarder. When I was twelve she lost custody of me over it and I had to go live with my abusive Father and Stepmother.

She still didn’t clean her act up.

When my sister gave her an ultimatum:

“Clean up the mess or my child will not be entering your abode” 

My Mother chose her “collectibles” over her own grandchild. She has not even met my youngest nephew. 

The only reason she’s not a hoarder right now is that she was finally evicted from her last apartment, the apartment was condemned, and we refused to pack up and move all of her “collectibles” again, so she lost everything she owned.

Your boyfriend is still young, and there is still time to help him find a way to collect things while not hoarding things. Hoarding is a disorder and he’s showing signs of being a hoarder. Please get him some help as soon as possible. Ask him to see a therapist. Make an agreement with him:

“You can only collect X amount of things and they have to be actual collectibles. Food is not a collectible”

I’m so dead-set on not being like my Mother that I limit myself completely. I have one box of knick-knacks. One. Period. We travel a lot, and we move all over the US... I have tiny bottles and I only allow myself to put something that will fit inside one of those bottles as my souvenir of the place we’ve been. I’m not saying that my behavior is exactly healthy either- I’m simply pointing out the effect that growing up with a hoarder has on a child.

EDIT:

If you’d like to see a glimpse of what your boyfriend’s future may look like if he doesn’t get his “collecting” under control and he continues to collect things that are health hazards, please follow this link (mind you, this is after we had already gotten rid of things, this is maybe my Mother’s 5th apartment in three years, and we had been getting rid of things between each move, plus, her landlord had already been through the apartment and taken everything that looked like it had any worth. What you’re seeing here is what was underneath all her “collections”):

Series over if celtics win tonight,0
"&gt;Eriksen has been poor for months not just for every couple of games imao. 

Eriksen has been overworked and forced to take on his normal attacking responsibilities in addition to covering for the complete lack of midfield, and during that time he's still managed to be the side's chief creative force and the hub of every period of dominance or positive play.

&gt;And Dele has been steadily regressing as a player for years and has had a really poor season too so far. How many goals has he scored this year? 4? 5? How many chances has created for other players? Did you even watch yesterday's game? Both have been very sub par.

Saying Dele's regressed is just nonsense. Last season was his best, most influential for Spurs yet. He's scoring less because he's simply playing a completely different role - he used to play directly off of Kane, he's been gradually moving deeper into a more conventional attacking midfield role and this season sometimes as an outright central midfielder. He started this season excellently, and until he started picking up niggling injuries he was playing some of his best ever football and was arguably the side's strongest performer. And same as Eriksen, the side just looks infinitely better when he's playing. You keep bringing up yesterday... Neither was bad at all, and when Sissoko came on to shore up the midfield their influence started growing and growing.

&gt;And do you know how hard is it to find versatile players like him who can play in 3-4 different positions? Just because he's plays better in the final third it doesn't mean he's a limited player imao. Imagine Eriksen playing as the focal point of attack. Or Dele. Do you think they will do just as a good job as him? They have different roles within the team, sure but that doesn't mean that somehow Dele and Eriksen are more well rounded players than Son.

Dele has played for Spurs in a double pivot, a midfield 3, as a 10, as a second striker, in a front 3... He's aerially strong in both boxes, he offers a passing outlet to the centre backs, he carries the ball from deep... How can you even suggest Son is as well rounded as him? That is nonsense.  Could Son play next to Wanyama like both these guys have done? Could he be the side's playmaker?


&gt;defensively?? That's why he played as a second right back and left back switching sides in the City game???

No? I don't at all. But I never even said Son doesn't contribute defensively, you've conjured that. He's simply not as effective as the other 2, covers less distance, has less physical presence...",1

"&gt; There have still been plenty of deep storylines, but that doesn't mean everything needs to be deep.

Yes, but one of KEY STORYLINES should be. 

&gt; But it was still the biggest threat.

Except no it wasn't. Because it got beaten in one battle, even when the good guys used some of the dumbest tactics possible. Cersei Lannister has caused Dany more problems than the Night's King did. Which is hardly congruent with the idea that he's 'the big threat'. 

&gt; but a character that doesn't communicate and spends all of its time on one purpose can't really be further developed by more screen time or flashbacks.

Except it can, as I later laid out.

&gt; Sure there's some intelligence, but there's no culture.

You literally cannot have one without the other. The Spartans created no art or literature and dedicated themselves solely to war, just like the N.K dedicated himself solely to killing humanity, but they still had a culture. 

If he's not an unthinking automaton, he must perforce have a culture. Even if the sole object of that culture is death.

&gt; The Craster thing I'll give you,
&gt; Another thing I'll bring up that lends more weight to your argument than mine 

You keep giving me things, have you not taken this as a sign that maybe I'm just right on this point?

&gt; I'm not saying the Night King is completely without free will, but his instincts to destroy are more powerful than any other emotion or thought he has.

Or how about that it's not a matter of instinct: he just *wants* to kill. 

&gt; It's possible he never turned on his creators. Maybe the CotF turned on him.

Fine. THEN IT WOULD BE NICE TO FIND OUT HOW THAT HAPPENED.

&gt; He might not care at all about them,

Considering according to the show's writers his spirals are deliberately done to mock them, no he does. 

&gt; You're right though that there could have been some kind of flashback to how that war ended and they drove back the NK the first time, 

Yes, precisely.

&gt; but that likely would have taken a tremendous amount of screen time and this show has always been reluctant to rely on flash backs.

Except to reveal the biggest character twist of the entire series?

and then you have all the kids on the comp sub who took high ground from a guy only to be body shot by a third party with a heavy sniper because they were standing at the top of their ramp peeking straight down exposing their entire body. lucky shots happen but not as much as comp players make it out to be. they act like every game they get heavy sniped in the toe while gliding when thats not true at all.

and 149 damage isnt gonna change much. instead of being one shot 150 you will be sniped and then popped with a stink or ar/smg spam. either way its a death sentence. imo all they need to do is give the heavy sniper the drop/bullet speed that the bolt action use to have but a damage reduction would be a bad either i guess",0

"&gt;First, let's recall what that dialog looked like

Ok. The dialogue looked like this:

&gt;""There is no evidence of collusion.""

Simple stuff.

&gt;There was an awful lot of smoke being reported by reputable sources, and there's not a single piece that NYT or WaPo or WSJ reported on the Trump-Rusiia front that Mueller Report disproved.

[You're wrong.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/donald-trump-russia-collusion-cia.html)

[I can do this all day.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/17/yes-there-was-collusion-now-what-will-we-do-about-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d7340256626f)

[There are literally dozens of articles.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/not-true-james-comey-denounces-nyt-report-on-trump-campaign-collusion-with-russia-during-testimony)

(Made sure to use WaPo and NYT articles just for you - there are plenty more, too - just let me know if you need them.)

&gt;So all the stuff that happened that caused us to call for an investigation is shit that *really did happen*.

[You mean a false report that was debunked mid investigation?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

&gt;The softening of the RNC platform, the multiple attempts to establish communication backdoors, the contact between Sessions and Kislayak, and him suibsequently lying about it, a ton of other Trump staffers and Trump himself getting caught lying about contact with Russians - all that was real.

\[Sources please.\]

&gt;What's not real is the characterization that there was ""no collusion"" according to the Mueller report. The accurate characterization is that there wasn't enough admissible evidence to indict for it. Here's what the report has to say on the subject in its opening paragraphs:

That's some hard-core mental gymnastics for a huge nothing burger. Try harder. Your opinion is irrelevant. Meullers isn't. And Meuller said: ""No Evidence of Collusion.""

No matter what you may think constitute evidence... it's irrelevant. Meuller found none and your opinion on the matter is now irrelevant. Thanks for sharing it, though.

&gt;The report proceeds to name Flynn, Papadopolous, Cohen and Manafort as those who got charged.

Are you pretending that these people are guilty of collusion? Because literally none were charged with anything remotely resembling collusion.

&gt;That's not a determination that there was no collusion/coordination/conspiracy. That's ""we investigated the campaign and found enough dirt to indict the campaign manager and his right-hand guy along with Flynn and Papadop. Everyone else covered their tracks well enough that we can't bring a case against them.""

If you investigate a murder and find out that the suspect and his buddies are drug dealers... you arrest them for dealing drugs. But that doesn't mean they're murderers.

In this case: If you investigate collusion and find evidence of Tax Fraud (from years prior and not associated with a ""Russian Collusion"" investigation) you arrest them for their crimes - but that doesn't mean you get to label them as a traitor.

You're trying really hard to make 2+2=5.

&gt;Then of course it's followed by a second half of the report that says ""by the way, here's an open-and-shut case on the president obstructing the everloving shit out of our investigation. Did we mention that's a federal felony? Hey Congress, time for you guys to do your job.""

You must have a gold medal for the Mental Gymnastic Olympics.  Do you know how quotes work? Because that was literally never said. You're paraphrasing with a ridiculous bias. You're painting "" ***The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him***,' as ""he is clearly guilty.""

That is blatantly false. It's about as neutral a statement as one can get (and mine is the actual quote).

Look - it's clear you're chomping at the bit to get Trump with something... but why?

What is your obsession with finding him doing something wrong? What would have to happen for you to rethink your position? What event would need to take place in order for you to take a critical look at the treatment of the President of the United States?",1

"&gt;Why the hell you sending cavalry in by itself

Dothraki are a field army. As Robert said ""[only a fool would fight the Dothraki on an open field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OitYP2MTYMg)""

&gt;having the riders carve the flanks to bits like a common fucking battle tactic.

There is no position advantage when fighting wights. Rear, front, sides its all the same.

&gt;Staying inside the keep and making it a battle of attrition you can win?

Battle of attrition against an undead army.  That doesn't eat, sleep, get tired, have emotion and can create another army of undead on the spot. Attrition is not something living people can do against the undead

I mean come on they instantly lost the walls, and even with the cavalry charge, two dragons clearing the open field, defense of the wall and courtyard the wights still made it to theon

&gt;Why not use the dragons to carve a path for the dothraki to charge into?

Clear a path to what exactly? A commander thats nowhere to be seen? Only thing you are doing is allowing whatever forces you cleared a path for to be more easily surrounded",1

"Has society really become so debased in recent times that we signal our respect to others by typing ""F""? How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - ""Call of Duty"", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and ""pressing F"". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice. I know I certainly get the impression of you acting like that bobbing duck toy (as shown). Are you a reasonable human being or a bobbing duck toy? Ask yourself that.

"&gt;And also that is the life of IT and Developers. Long hours, over time, lack of sleep. It comes with the territory.

that doesnt make it ok. we need to change how these jobs are looked at. no one should be working that many hours, willingly or not. it isnt healthy. 


also i can guarantee epic didnt say ""hey we are gonna work you 14+hours every single day for as long as you work here. sound good?"". what is more likely is that the amount of work wasnt specified and they are somewhat getting taken advantage of.

here are some quotes from epic employees so maybe you can see how they actually feel about it.


'If I got to the end of an eight-hour workday and I turned to my supervisor to ask if I needed to stay on, they’d often look at me as if I was actively stupid. Officially, you don’t have to keep working, but in reality: ‘Sit back down, we’ll be here for a while.’ If you did not do overtime, that was a mark against your character.”



“If a build went out into the wild and there was a negative reaction, then someone at the top would say, ‘We need to change that,’” one source told Polygon, “and everyone would be pulled in from what they were doing, and people were told to cancel their plans, because they were going to crunch until this was done. It was never-ending. It’s great for supporting the community and for the public. But that comes at a cost.”


(not a quote but important)Contract staff in Epic’s quality assurance and customer service departments spoke of a stressful and hostile working environment in which working overtime — while officially voluntary — was an expected service to the company.


(SUPER IMPORTANT)Although contract staff were paid overtime, developers report a culture of fear, in which they were expected to pull long hours as part of their job. Some reported suffering health issues after working consecutive months of 70-hour weeks.
""culture of fear'. people are reporting health issues because of it.


Polygon interviewed current and former employees of Epic, including full-time staff, managers, and contractors working in development, QA, and customer service departments. They all requested that their identities be protected, for fear of retribution from Epic or other employers in the game industry. Epic requires that current and former staff sign nondisclosure agreements limiting their ability to speak about the company’s operations.
^says they are afraid to even disclose this info and how long they work due to fear of consequences. do you think epic really told them how long they would be working? wouldnt be afraid if they had all agreeed.

Dowry in Chinese culture is not a law but tradition.  Husbands also often help out with wife's family.  You may not want to follow that, which is completely fine, but it sound like you don't actually know the Chinese family cultures and traditions. 

There is no fucking law against dowry in Canada. It is not illegal, just not recognized by law all the time in the specific cultural senses (which depends on the culture) but there has been court ruling to include a dowry.

In Chinese culture, dowry is made to the bride's family by the husband, not the other way round. And if a couple split, wife can still be rewarded a split of networth of the husband, or the other way round, for that matter.

I had property before I married but I recognize that once I get married, my husband can get a share of my networth/property. I love him and am happy to share ny life and everything in it with him.

"There are over 7,500 universities and 5,500 fraternity chapters in America. Hazing is bound to happen at some of them, especially in south and to be honest, conservative states in general, but it's not the gold standard, and not all hazing is the 3rd degree shit that you read about online. IFC (official) frats are also far less likely to haze. It's the non-IFC frats that haze, and haze hard (even at my alma mater) - so avoid them like the plague.

Additionally, the definition of hazing is so damn murky. At my alma mater, hazing was loosely defined by the administration as making someone do something they don't want to do. Is an event where everyone has to play Edward 40 hands really hazing? How about memorizing the Greek alphabet and chapter/fraternity history (which is easy to remember), then getting quizzed and having to do push-ups if you get the answers wrong? How about scavenger hunts that involved fun, but questionable activities? How about cleaning the frat house after parties we also went to? The only event that I think was actual hazing was the night they brought strippers to the house. In addition to normal things like lap dances and making us lay down and hold lollipops in our mouth that would penetrate them as they rode our faces, they also shit talked, smacked, and straight up whipped some of us while everyone, including our fellow pledge brothers, laughed our asses off at the madness. It was a fucking blast.

Exemptions for things like disabilities were **always** made, and in retrospect, a lot these were just team building exercises, as unifying everyone against the dick pledgemaster was similar to how boot camp and drill sergeants, just a thousand times easier. The wild shit that my pledge brothers and I endured is why the bonds I have with them are stronger than the bonds I have with any other friends I've ever made. Some fraternities go a bit harder, but as long as it doesn't endanger your health or sanity, it'll be drowned out by all the fun nights and you'll oddly look bad at it fondly. Pledge is universally known as ""the best time you'll never want to have again,"" and it truly is that.


One thing I'd like to add for anyone who wants to or is currently pledging: if the fraternity you're pledging starts *really* hazing you, eg, putting your life in danger, physically harming you, and taking things like the yelling too far to the point that you can't handle it emotionally, then drop. That is, unless you plan on going into the military, in which case it's good practice, because the military hazes harder than pretty much any modern frat.",1

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

I've been a member of a dog school for a little over a year now. The school is big and offers a whole host of activities. I joined their mantrailing group (dog finds 'lost' human). We meet up every two weeks on the weekend. It's very low key, there's not much teaching and no serious technical instructions. We get a few short lessons about the basics when we join and then we're pretty much on our own. 

I have done mantrailing in different organizations/clubs where it IS technical and goes way beyond the basics, so I can tell the difference.

For a while I've wanted to mantrail more often than every two weeks. However most other organizations in the neighborhood are expensive or a long drive away or only on the weekends, ... So I talked to some people at the mantrailing about starting a flexible FB group to meet up every now and again and mantrail near where we live during weeknights. Whenever someone had some time they could post and if there were one or two others they could go mantrail! I mentioned this personally to the two dog school instructors (A&amp;B) who organize the mantrailing group, they weren't interested but didn't say anything else.

Recently I made the FB group and I didn't remember who from the mantrailing group was interested so I asked the dog school if it would be okay to post something about it on the dog school's mantrailing group's FB. They never directly said no about posting to their page but they kicked me out of the dog school instead. 

There was a lot of confusing communication at first but eventually A explained to me it was because the owner of the dog school is tired of people learning skills at their dog school and then starting their own school or organization without the school financially benefiting. My FB group is considered competition for their school. They called me disrespectful for creating the FB group in the first place. 

I don't agree at all that my group is competition (different times, different set-up, no teaching at all, ...) and I don't understand why they would think that. As for learning skills and passing them on... It's absurd to say nobody who is in your school is allowed to use those skills outside of it. 

I don't think I am the asshole at all but my partner and I were wondering what perspective Reddit can offer. AITA?

"So many of your questions were answered, though. Bran was observing the battle through the crows to make sure everything continued to line up, that's why he followed the night king, and that is why he looked past the night king to make sure Arya was there.
The dagger was Valaryan steal, which the show said multiple times kills White walkers (Jon even killed one).
The Night king was created by the children of the forest to destroy mankind. The night king interpreted that as removing mankind from the world, which included killing Bran, who effectively held the entire knowledge of humanity with him.
Melisandre was there, like Berrick and the hound, to fulfill the prophecy and help Arya on her way to killing the Night King. She was the one who told Arya she was supposed to go after him.
Why would the Wights risk fighting personally when the entire Castle is outfitted with the only two things that could kill them? THAT would have been some seriously bad writing. It would make more sense to let your massive replenishing horde desimate the castle THEN go in a take out Bran (would suck if there were a trained assassin waiting to ambush you, but what chance is there of that happening, amiright?)

Does kindness have no place in this world, in this society of ours? Why is compassion largely been neglected? It's an important thing. What makes someone great is their kindness and compassion for others. Cows are great animals, as great as dogs. They form families, mother cows love their babies. Dogs and cats aren't the only animals that can feel this precious thing called love. And they feel pain as much as you and me. Who likes to feel pain? Who likes being sad? We steal their babies from them as soon as they're born so we can suck all of their milk for us. It makes mother cows bellow and cry for days. If my pain matters then their pain matters too, pain is pain, no matter who feels it. If you don't like causing sadness stop drinking milk, stop eating meat. It's inhumane. We can make a better society than this. There are millions of us vegans right now and hopefully you can be the next one. All you need is an open mind and an open heart.

There was never going to be the NK going to Kings Landing, why would he? He doesn’t care who’s there, there’s no way he would know who’s there or how many.

"I really see no solution to the crisis in Venezuela other than moving the revolutionary process forward.  There is no compromise to be found with the capitalists in Venezuela: it is either forward to socialism, or a brutal slide back to capitalism, “structural adjustments,” austerity, and so on. 

The productive forces must be put under democratic workers’ control so that production can be planned to meet the needs of the Venezuelan people and to resist the manipulations of the capitalists.  

The state apparatus must cede power to the organized workers councils and revolutionary peasant communes to avoid a situation, which Hugo Chavez explicitly warned about, where the Venezuelan state assumes a self-perpetuating reactionary position.  The organized revolutionary workers and peasants also must be armed, the opposition leaders exiled or arrested, and foreign debt canceled.  

If the revolution succeeds, Venezuela could be an inspiration to workers across Latin America, and the revolution could easily spread across national borders.",0

"No problem. That first paragraph was how the movie portray it though. 

In the books, Faramir first visits his father for council before being sent to defend Osgiliath. That defense failed miserably, and the survivors barely escaped as they were being chased by the entire enemy host, as they went straight from the river to the gates of Minas Tirith.

It was then that Gandalf did his sortie to chase the Nazgul away, together with the Prince of Dol Amroth and his knights (the ""fancy boys"" from above, hundreds of them) as mounted orcs and Southerlings had caught up as well by then. Faramir was the last of the surviving troops to enter the city, unconscious and in the arms of that Prince.

"This issue isn’t about rights at all. So you can’t so easily shrug away the abortion argument. This issue about whether an action is morally “wrong” or not, which is perfectly applicable to the killing of an unborn child, regardless of where the government stands on that child’s rights.  

If you are still afraid to approach the topic of abortion, then imagine that the unborn child develops into a little baby immediately. Then it gestates in there, kicking, squirming, and sleeping, for 9 months.  

Would you be opposed to abortion in that hypothetical scenario?  

Would you consider a woman who aborts after rape to be a reprehensible person?  

&gt; This is also not a question of the rights an individual has to self-determination, nor have I suggested that a man should be forced or coerced into having a relationship he doesn't want. This is a question of taking responsibility for the decisions one makes, instead of trying to shift the blame onto someone else.  

**This sounds a lot like rape victim blaming.**  

There’s a reason we use the word “fraud” in these cases.  

Fraud implies that you deceived someone into making a decision. The father thought that he was deciding to raise his biological child but the mother was defrauding him. Therefore, the father never made this “decision” that you claim he did.  

Unless of course, you believe Brock Turner was wrongfully concocted, and we should hold that girl responsible for her “decision”.   

Again, I think your argument falls apart the moment you treat men and women equally.",0

"Don't believe Polish newspapers when it comes to news about Norwegian cross-country skiing. They have proved time and time again that they have an agenda, and want to portray it in a light that is as bad as possible.

He was a part of the panel that was looking for a replacement though, which is natural since he was the most senior administrator on the team. In any regard, it was by no means his decision to make, since the final decision where he was given more responsibility was taken without him, since it was about him. Also, the thing about speaking with one candidate is just not true.

The panels recommendations (which he may have been part of forming) was sent to the Cross Country Skiing Committee (which he is not a part of) who made the decision. So he did not hire himself at all.

Edit: Edited in a couple of quotes and some depth :)

On the restructure:

&gt; Bjervig: ""The Cross Country skiing committee have decided that we are to be organised in a new way. I've talked to them, and been informed underway during the process. My job will be mostly the same as before, but a bit closer to the sporting side"".

&gt; Press release from the Ski Federation: ""Pål Rise will get responsibility for administrative functions and human resource development, Ulf Morten Aune will get monitoring responsibilities for Pará Elite (Paralympics team), junior- and recruitment teams to give Bjervig the freedom to properly follow up on the elite men- and womens cross-country teams"".

Furthermore, Bjervig is a former elite skier himself who competed in the 90s, who has taken an economics degree and comes recommended from the private sector. He has also done a good job before this, and was also one of the leading candidates for the job when the chief who resigned recently was selected.",0

"OK, so this 12-year-old now knows that her dad cheated and is a shitty person. Now what? She’s going to be living with him for the next six years at least, she’s going to be emotionally invested in him likely for the rest of his life, while OP is basically going to be out of her life after this. 

What’s the actual benefit in her knowing the details of this? “Your dad is a shithead who cheated, btw bye see you never!” Great, so the child loses a person who was in her life, and now potentially thinks terribly of and doesn’t trust her actual parent. That’s just perfect! Where do things go from here? Surely up, for those rosy teenage years when nothing ever goes wrong!

OP basically got to drop a bomb and walk out in the aftermath. I am in no way justifying what happened to her. It completely sucks that this person she loved cheated on her, and what the dad did is complete shit. However, it’s not like OP is going to be around to do anything for this kid in the future. So setting fire to the dad‘s relationship with the daughter, doesn’t really accomplish anything except hurting the child.

This sub has an obsession with completely telling the entire truth, regardless of context, at all times. It is an extremely immature mindset lacking nuance. In the real world, telling the entire unvarnished truth is not always the best move.",1

"**Welcome  to part 3 of the coverage of the XFL. Before we start, I wanna state for the record I don’t necessarily agree with everything said here. As a mod for XFL subreddit, I want to see the league succeed. With that being said, let’s begin.**

**When we last left off, the XFL was still in development. Now, we’re in week 2. And already, we’re seeing signs of issues. First, here are a compilation of quotes from people in the wrestling business, some taken from the McMahon DVD and others being from miscellaneous. This is part 3 of a 5 part series I’m doing. Part 4 will cover Jesse Ventura’s friend (We’ll reveal who when we get there) and part 5 will cover the XFL’s close and also showcase the oral history SB Nation did on the XFL. Enjoy.**

Ivory: We were just pissed. We were pissed. I kept always saying ""I just wanna meet the guy who’s jersey and helmet came out of my paycheck"". You know, we try not to talk about money too much in our car rides but we decided, one car ride— I remember it was with Bob Holly and some other people— we decided that, across the board, all of our royalties had gone down by 10%. So, we were like ""Hmm…"" So, these damn guys better be doing it right because they’re running around on our cash. Our livelihoods.

Joey Styles: The first thing you saw when the first XFL game came on the air on a Saturday night on NBC was The Rock. It wasn’t about football at that point. The next thing I saw was Vince McMahon, himself, in an XFL jacket walking to midfield with his over-the-top Mr. McMahon voice saying

(Clip of Vince McMahon saying ""This is the XFL"" plays)

Joey Styles: And I think what happened was by not letting the XFL live on its own without any WWE personalities, all of the WWE hating media, right or wrong, jumped on the XFL. and if that didn’t do it, the cheerleaders surely did, because there was sure as hell a big difference between traditional football cheerleaders and the strippers that were cheerleading for the XFL grinding in those outfits.

Eric Bischoff: Had the XFL been a 3 year plan or a 5 year plan, I think it would probably be around today. It would’ve changed the sports industry as we know it.

Bob Costas: I think it should have been as obvious as steering clear of a dark alley in a dangerous neighborhood. Everything about it screamed to me schlock and crap. Everything that subsequently occurred validated that impression. In fairness, Dick Ebersol never asked me. None of the announcers who were associated with NBC were going to be used on this experiment, so there was never any danger of that.

Bruce Prichard: This is developed on the private jet on the way to the first game. On a Wednesday before the first game. We start talking about what we used to do as kids. We used to put a football in the middle of the street and line up at opposite ends and whoever got the football first started with it. It was street football, that’s how we played street football. ""I love it"", Vince said.

It wasn’t discussed with any football people, not discussed with any coaches or players or any input from the football experts — It’s Michael Hayes, Bruce Prichard, Brian Gerwitz, Stephanie McMahon, Vince McMahon, and Dick Ebersol. So we were like, ""What do we call that""? I think Michael Hayes came up with the name ""Scramble"".

**Also, before the XFL premiered, they shot a bunch of promos highlighting the cheerleaders. There was only one problem: they were all dancers. They touted the cheerleaders as having day jobs like one being a doctor and one being a teacher except they were all dancers. Here’s what Bruce Prichard said about that.**

Bruce Prichard: So, I end the meeting kind of abruptly and I grabbed this lady and I said ""What the fuck""? I can make shit work, but now I’ve got to go back and explain to Vince that I got a chick that likes to read math books, I got a chick that works at a lawyer office, a chick that used to work at a doctor’s office or a chick that wanted to be a lawyer and um…

Conrad: Two dozen dancers.

Bruce Prichard: They’re all dancers! And I said ""What the fuck?"" ""Well, tomorrow will be a better group"". ""I’ve got to shoot shit today!""

Conrad: Yeah

Bruce Prichard: So, essentially, I just made shit up.

(Conrad laughs hard)

Bruce Prichard: I took the bitch that worked at a lawyer’s office, I put her in a lawyer’s office, man. I had her be a lawyer.

Conrad: Coming in hot with that language.

Bruce Prichard: I had the one— oh, this is another good one. This was one, we’ve got a sport trainer or something like that. So, I go talk to her. She dateda trainer in high school. I said ""Well, great. You’re gonna be my athletic trainer"". I took the chick that liked to read math books— now, get this: she liked to read math books but she hated math and she couldn’t do any math problems. So, I had to have her go bring me one of those math books and we just did a complicated math problem on the wall. And here’s my favorite part of all. When we divvied up crews and everything, I said ""You know what? I’ll take these girls, Michael, you and Brian, you go take these girls, and you take your crew and I’ll do my crew"". Well, I made it so that my crew and all my girls, I could shoot everything right there at the stadium. I just did backstage stuff and I made a training room, I made a classroom, I just made shit up there. And Stephanie McMahon stayed with me and helped me produce and Michael and them were up until the wee hours of the morning having to shoot stuff on location in Las Vegas. It SUCKKKKKKED. Because they were just local dancers.",1

The NK putting himself in the fray would be equivalent to Voldemort handing Harry a silver platter with every horcrux on it in his left hand and the sword of Godric Gryffindor in his right hand. Metaphorically, NK was basically the last horcrux (even worse) and he wasn't smart enough to lock himself up where no human could get to him until all the humans were obliterated by his automated army.

I find the stupidity of the NK very disappointing. Apparently ""protect NK at all costs"" wasn't in his plan at all. He could have benefited from one-on-one strategy lessons with Tywin Lannister.",0

"Has society really become so debased in recent times that we signal our respect to others by typing ""F""? How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - ""Call of Duty"", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and ""pressing F"". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice. I know I certainly get the impression of you acting like that bobbing duck toy (as shown). Are you a reasonable human being or a bobbing duck toy? Ask yourself that.

"I actually think it makes sense. NK has been patiently waiting north of the wall for 7 seasons waiting for winter plus a way through the wall. The moment he has those (nice work giving him a dragon guys...) he attacks. 

Consider the logistics the living must take into account when waging war - time and cost of raising, equipping and training troops, moving them to battle and keeping them fed. They also have to defend their own lands and positions. Even if they have little regard for human life, they at least see their soldiers as a resource that shouldn't be wasted which limits their ability to wage all out war. Makes sense they'd normally spend so much time and energy on political intrigue to gain advantage, and only make battle when they felt they had the advantage or there was no other choice. 

NK has none of that to worry about. There's no lands or castles he has to hold. No logistics to consider beyond time to move his army into position and when to attack. And the crazy thing is, the more people die the BIGGER his army will be at the end of the battle. 

That makes all out zerg attack a viable strategy. He has an overwhelming force, all he has to do is break Winterfell, refresh his army, then he can march south collecting more wights as he goes. Repeat at King's landing. 

The living know this and must also go all in to either defeat him forever or die trying. There's no negotiation or politics to be played. Every battle makes them weaker and their opponent stronger.",0

While you two are taking time alone to think I think this is something you need to really do some hard thinking about. After two years together it’s fair for your GF to want a better idea of if/when you’ll be interested in marriage than “i don’t know”. 

Consider what would it take for you to feel ready for marriage?

Do you need to hit a life goal before you’re ready? Travel? Get a better job? Save up a certain amount? 

Do you want to hit a certain relationship goal? Dating/living together for a certain amount of time? Handle some relationship dynamic issues?

Or is there an age by which you’d ideally like to be married by? If so then you’d probably want to get engaged 6 months to two years before then (depending on how long you’d like to be engaged). 

Is there an age by which you’d ideally have your first/only child by (if you want kids)? If so then you would probably want to be married at least a year or more before then.",0

"I wasn’t saying that dragons in and of themselves existing is the unbelievable thing. Dragons should not exist because they’d collapse under their own weight. It has nothing to do with magic, that’s just science and logic. Same thing with a skeleton hand punching through solid rock.

If those things are okay, then so should someone managing to disentangle themselves from a swarm with the use of their one-shot zombie lightsabers and the aid of close-by allies. Otherwise, you’re utilizing *selective suspension,* where something’s that break reality and logic and somethings aren’t just because you wanted to see some more dead main characters. 

That’s my thing. The more I hear people saying it’s a matter of believability and physics and whatever, the more it just doesn’t add up because if you actually cared about these characters and their struggles and stories and lives, then the fact they did survive despite these insurmountable odds should be joyous. Instead it seems like it matters more that fucking Isaac Newton’s math homework should be respected and just *bitch, bitch, bitch.* If you like these people and this story, then why it is such a big deal? Why the endless debates? Especially when there’s not been a precedent for major characters dying in battle, and statistically speaking, that’s when a main character is the safest. Name me a main character or major supporting character who has died in the thick of battle like everyone seemed to expect this episode. There was Ygritte. That’s the only one who comes to my mind.

I understand it’s an issue, maybe they should have shot those scenes to be less dogpile-y or Arya’s leap should be shorter or whatever else, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad writing or a bad story. It’s bad math and bad physics, but math and physics and even *logic herself* are not the rulers of Story-Town. They can advise on some things, but they do not make the final call. Even in Game of Thrones, they’ve never made the final call. And if that’s your primary concern when it comes to stories, then maybe you need to re-examine your priories.",1

He makes you think Ned is the guy that's gonna solve it all and get to the root of the problem with the corrupt throne. Then it's Robb and Cat, with some aid from Renly. Then it's Stannis. But all of these were masterfully crafted red herrings. None of those characters were ever the ""main characters"" you just *thought* they were. The protagonists have always been Jon, Arya, Sansa, Theon to an extent, Dany, Bran (but I've got theories that he's not just a wholesome greenseer) If you look back at all of she sticky situations the actual main characters were in over the years, you can see that they were *never in real danger*. Why would Arya die a blind panhandler in bravos? Why would Sansa get tortured to death by ramsay Bolton? Ask yourself, ""for what purpose would this character die?"" and in every situation our main heroes were in over the years, them dying at that time made zero fucking sense. *There has always been plot armor*. Fucking Valyrian steel, dragonglass studded plate armor on every God damn one of our protagonists.

Now, I understand the gripes people have with the unrealistic situations Sam was in in ep3, Grey worm to a certain extent, yeah I guess Lyannas death was a bit cheesy on my 3rd re-watch but when it was live, I fucking loved it. I get that having *only* redshirt die in the crypts was a bit unbelievable. I wouldn't of minded maybe 2 more minor characters die who's arcs were complete like Grey worm and missandei.

"If you're looking for a real answer, it's because ""energy storage"" is still a conundrum for the energy revolution. There's really 3 sides of energy: energy production, energy delivery, and energy storage. For the most part, we kinda figured out energy production. Solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal, hydro, really there are a lot of ways to produce energy. But once it's created, what do we do with it is the real question. If it's not used right away then well...how do we deliver it to people? Should we just store it and then discharge it when demand is necessary? This is often the case when you have an ""excess"" of energy, like if you have a giant swath of solar panel farms in the super sunny desert countryside adjacent to a highway. It produces a ton of energy but nowhere to go. Energy delivery and storage is a logistical nightmare that we still haven't solved yet.

Some think the answer is lithium ion batteries, but I think that's kinda wasteful since (1) lithium is rare, expensive, and extracting it is horrible for the environment; (2) the main benefit of lithium for high energy density is wasted when it stays put like in a grid. That still doesn't stop Elon Musk from shipping out large batches of battery packs for energy storage. Some think it might be \[liquid batteries\]( [https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ambri-is-still-alive-and-chasing-its-liquid-metal-battery-dreams#gs.97hhjr](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ambri-is-still-alive-and-chasing-its-liquid-metal-battery-dreams#gs.97hhjr) ) which I thought was a cool idea albeit still in lab development phase. Some might think it's using the excess energy to split water and transport H2 to solve the energy logistics. However this method is still inefficient as the best catalyst to do this is platinum.

Tl;dr - Energy production isn't the problem, it's energy storage/delivery that wouldn't be solved by having giant swaths of solar panels in the middle of nowhere.",0

What is that reason? Some would argue that it is because the are people who believe that youth under 18 shouldn't know anything about sex or sexuality. They may also consider such places to be perverse.

&gt;...isn't being overly sexual a sign of being sexually abused? Like ya kids start exploring at that age but I feel sex toys pushes it a bit too far.

Not really. It needs to be considered within an environmental context. The child is likely learning about sex in school and is curious. This is a sensitive period, and not a good time to shame them (if there is one).

&gt;Also if a 6th grader told her teacher or someone she trusted that her parents were buying her sex toys, CPS would be getting involved.

There may be questions since it isn't the norm. A social worker would want to determine the circumstances of the matter, but there wouldn't be an apprehension for allowing a child to explore their sexual development in a healthy way.",1

Or are we saying she can’t possibly enjoy her work (we all know women hate sex). 

So yes it is exploitative to sell your body in a capitalist society no one has made the argument otherwise. The real question is what are you defining as sex therapy?

I frankly don't understand what stand your ground laws have to with this thread which started when someone commented  ""I am glad he is dead."" Obviously it's not ethical to burglarize someone's house and the action is not excusable at all and it was entirely his choice to enter her home and he had to face the consequences of that. But when someone says ""I am glad he is dead"" it is basically saying that this is the best possible outcome? Is that really the case?

I feel the appropriate response to this should be ""it's unfortunate that she had to kill someone but I am glad she was able to defend her property. Not ""I am glad he is dead.""",1

"Homosexuals had to come a long way, for years being openly homosexual meant a life of poverty. Especially if you were male. It was through their hard work and integrity that got them to rise above.

True Indians and other Asians are immigrating here with a positive mindset, but they had to struggle through poverty as well. Hence the many businesses that we use to jokingly call Asian (dry cleaning, nail care) was just them trying to get their foot in the door, trusting that if they get their kids educated and focus them on success, they’ll live a happy life in the west. Because it can be overcome.

To me nobody is inherently criminal and poor in the west. What we are is responsible for our own choices, and we either accept that or we don’t. People that don’t fail, people that do succeed. I don’t think American society overall promotes people to be irresponsible, I think groups of people develop their pocket cultures and their pocket cultures promotes them to be irresponsible. And personally, I think those pocket cultures that promote irresponsible behavior are finally starting to erode. I think videos like this really point out that mindset and I’m sure now that guys family knows how they sound by now. Maybe it’s pride that keeps them from admitting it? At a guess anyhow.",1

"I do not see this as valid criticism. I actually see this as criticism for the sake of criticism. Just because none of the 10 fan theories you read came to be true, doesn’t mean you start finding flaws where there aren’t any lol.

Why did the main characters survive? Think about it strong and hard, what possible explanation could there be for Brienne, Jon, Danny, tormund, jamie to survive? Well it’s because all of these guys are exceptional warriors and have been portrayed as such throughout the show (exception Danny but she has dragons lol). Throughout the show, each and every one of these individuals has been shown to be more courageous, more determined, more skilled than the others at combat. If any one survived, it should be these people.

Jorah mormont survives the first charge because he is a more accomplished warrior compared to the dothrakis - there is nothing that should be surprising here. Greyworm survived because he is the leader of the unsullied and why is that? Because he is the best of the unsullied.

Jon and Danny survived because they had dragons and weren’t part of the battle for the most part.

Bran survived because he had a full blown mini army protecting him, plus a certain Arya who is perhaps one of the most accomplished assassins ever to set foot in Westeros.

Why did Tyrion and Sansa survive, because they were the smartest of the people in the crypt and took shelter and hid when others did not think to do so.

I mean if you’re going to talk about plot armor, how the fuck did the night king not die of dragon fire when Danny smoked his ass? I see no one complaining about that.

Yes, the battle of winterfell wasn’t perfect but, for anything that hyped, how can it even be perfect? Out of tens of millions watching the show, there were always going to be subsets who were going to have issues with the story and the plot.

All the people complaining right now, it just makes no sense to me because if you want to talk about plot armor, each and every character has been in extremely dangerous situations before and guess what, they all made it to the last season.  I guess what you folks really wanted is for everyone to die in season 3 lol.",1

"&gt;doesn’t seem earned 

Lmao. 

&gt;2 minor changes 

Your two minor changes are to nerf her and remove two scenes that were specifically crafted to show how powerful she is lmao.


Her movie already established that she can destroy ships without issue by flying through them, I don’t see why that scene would be an issue for you. 

And her the headbutt drawing blood in that situation just reads weird, idk what you’re thinking with that. She is incredibly strong so of course she would have amazing stability and stand her ground is a grappling contest: her skin is nearly as tough as Thor’s or Thanos’ so why would a headbutt from him draw blood when even Iron Man’s armor can take one just fine. This post is such a « she’s too powerful nerf her » whine.

Every hero doesn’t need a ‘get knocked down get back up again’ arc, every hero doesn’t even need an arc. You can contribute to a story as a side character without going through an arc. What was Doctor Strange’s arc in Infinity War? He literally sees into the future and just executes the future he saw, making sure every box was checked. Should they have nerfed him too or made it so Thanos defeated him more easily in the duel?

"It’s like we’re right back in 2016 with Bernie supporters telling POC’s that issues which specifically impact their communities don’t matter. A blanket answer of “I’m going to tell everyone racism isn’t tolerated and fix the economy” and “I marched with MLK that one time”, just feels like outright pandering at best, and at worst a complete lack of awareness or understanding of the plight minority groups face. Warren at least was able to offer policy initiatives in the form of addressing the severe disparity in maternal care for black women.

I’m sure there will also be the same dumbfounded reactions from his supporters as it was in 2016 when he again fails to capture votes from minority demographics. His supporters should instead of dismissing the concerns of minorities as “causing division”, or condescending remarks such as “who are they going to vote for trump” (we aren’t even in primary territory yet ffs), put aside their personal feelings and try to listen to their fellow voters concerns, and use that to actively push the campaign to craft a message and policy that addresses them. 

That said, *I* will still vote for whomever wins the primary, but I at least understand the apathy of minority voters who just see more of the same empty hollow promises and platitudes, and simply sit it out because things won’t change regardless, and instead only get worse.",1

"I think there's a delicate balance that needs to be maintained between logical character choices and what makes good TV. I think if Arya just silently snuck up behind him and stabbed him in the back, that likely would have also been perceived as anticlimactic. The jump out of the darkness really gives the moment excitement and is amazing to watch in slow motion. Plus, I'm convinced Arya needed to stab the NK in the heart through the front of his chest in the same manner he was created in order for him to die, so the writers essentially needed her to do something that would make him turn around, hence the yell. I think you could probably argue that a guttural yell of rage may have actually been quite natural / involuntary in that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The same could be said for the complaints regarding the strategies used during the battle. Yes, in real life, maybe the wights and WWs could have easily just surrounded Winterfell and starved everyone out. Maybe they could have sent another WW henchman to fetch Bran and bring him to the NK. Maybe Dany could have slowly and methodically burned up bunches of wights while Jon guarded Bran.

"I'm not going to go so far as to claim George Lucas' politics are very good, frankly I don't know enough about his politics to say but I'm skeptical of anyone with the amount of money he has.

But I think if you don't acknowledge that the prequels are a very intentional critique of liberalism's vulnerability to fascism, you don't give the man enough credit.

Here are some quotes:

&gt; I grew up in the ’60s. I grew up in San Francisco. And so I’m informed in a certain kind of way about, you know, believing in democracy and believing in America. And I’m a very ardent patriot. But I’m also a very ardent believer in democracy, not capitalist democracy. And I do not believe that the rich should be able to buy the government. And that’s just the way I feel.

&gt; I didn't want to do a movie about how people take over democracy. I wanted to figure out how democracies give themselves over to tyrants.

-

&gt; James Cameron: You did something interesting with Star Wars. The good guys are the rebels, they're using asymmetric warfare against a highly organized empire... I think we call those guys terrorists today. We call them Mujahideen, we call them Al Qaueda.

&gt; George Lucas: When I did it they were Viet Cong.

It’s not like she was belittling him. He wanted a 3 some and got one. Just because it didn’t go his way doesn’t mean she should feel guilty for going through something he suggested. Things come with consequences and if he can’t take them then why would he put himself in that position let alone take it out on her. It’s not her fault the other girl was saying that and he could have stood up for himself. She isn’t his mom to baby him when other peoples word hurt. He should have be like hey your crossings a line I don’t like this.,0
"She said she withheld sex when she didn’t get what she wanted, like fancy date nights and gifts. That’s a form of withholding affection, but equating it to sex work is a major stretch when we’re talking about a monogamous relationship. Theoretically, a very spoiled and old fashioned housewife could be considered a whore, even if she’s literally only had sex with her husband. That doesn’t seem just a *little* weird?

And it’s funny how we’re also putting the onus of judgment on the “whore” and not the man that tolerated her behavior enough to remain in a relationship with her. I wonder why OP didn’t call his friend a pathetic john if he *legitimately* thinks his lady is a whore.

A whore can’t be a whore without a john.",1
"OK, so this 12-year-old now knows that her dad cheated and is a shitty person. Now what? She’s going to be living with him for the next six years at least, she’s going to be emotionally invested in him likely for the rest of his life, while OP is basically going to be out of her life after this. 

What’s the actual benefit in her knowing the details of this? “Your dad is a shithead who cheated, btw bye see you never!” Great, so the child loses a person who was in her life, and now potentially thinks terribly of and doesn’t trust her actual parent. That’s just perfect! Where do things go from here? Surely up, for those rosy teenage years when nothing ever goes wrong!

OP basically got to drop a bomb and walk out in the aftermath. I am in no way justifying what happened to her. It completely sucks that this person she loved cheated on her, and what the dad did is complete shit. However, it’s not like OP is going to be around to do anything for this kid in the future. So setting fire to the dad‘s relationship with the daughter, doesn’t really accomplish anything except hurting the child.

I mean come on they instantly lost the walls, and even with the cavalry charge, two dragons clearing the open field, defense of the wall and courtyard the wights still made it to theon

I'd like to say right out of the gate there has been no arguments at all, she doesnt even know I'm upset, so there nothing there. 

Anyway,

My gf is an artist, and she's super talented. She has one of those ig art accounts and recently a few of her posts got a lot of attention (about 13000 likes for each) and she gained 500 followers practically overnight. I'm thrilled for her, as I totally think she deserves this. 

However,

I make music. Not very good music in my opinion, but I've been told that my writing is excellent and I needed to work on my delivery of said writing. So that's what I've been doing, but lately I've been down because it doesn't seem to be working, and I feel like giving up. Then this happens for my gf, and although I'm happy for her, every time she talks about how much she's succeeding (which she talks about a lot lately) it just reminds me how much I'm failing.

"To your point, it’s interesting to note that the “original” first-person shooter video games (Wolfenstein 3D and Doom) were released in 1992 and 1993 respectively. These titles were revolutionary and made the entire “shooter” genre very popular. By the late 90s (when Columbine occurred), the games had become much more common, realistic and violent. To this day, First-person shooter games such as Call of Duty or Halo are among the most popular video games in America. 

Is it purely coincidental that young males started shooting their classmates shorty after we literally turned shooting people into a game? Many of the shooters have been reported to be avid fans of games of that genre. 

To expand upon this idea, I think it’s important to see that our problem with shootings in America is far to broad and complex to blame on any one issue. It is a combination of a fascination with murderers; a 24 hour news cycle that is desperate for ratings; a society that has become desensitized to violence through violent movies/shows/games; a worship of the military creating “wannabe soldiers”; a poor public education system; a poor mental health system;  and, yes, the wide availability of firearms. 

Many other factors work in as well, those are just some of the larger ones. Point is, there is no single issue to blame. Frequent shootings, be it gang violence, active shooters, accidents or suicides are a uniquely American problem due to a culmination of other unique American problems.",1

"It’s true. Businesses have pervaded the election process. 

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0

""Hate Facts"" as they are known are always a ""carriage in front of the horse"" type of deal. You have to look at what a persons agenda is when you are analyzing their argument.

"Barr said in a press conference, ""special counsel Mueller did not indicate that his purpose was to leave the decision to Congress.""


Mueller's report, ""“The conclusion that Congress may apply obstruction laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.”

Why are you ok with Barr concluding there was no obstruction when he was clearly lying about Mueller's intent to leave that decision to Congress?  You appear to be his defender since you just concluded it was the AG's decision to make.

Found out a week beforehand that she had cheated on me,  and broke up within a week of arriving to college.

"Not trying to argue or say you are wrong by any means (in fact, consensus opinion would seem to dictate that *I* am the one wrong), but this is why I don't understand. Here would be my breakdown of the same points.

Plot: Nothing special. Truly, it's a standard point A to point B plot, with a fresh coat of dusty, Australian paint. 

Soundtrack: Awesome, I agree.

Sound mixing: Eh, I mean I have no complaints and I guess that's all you can ask for. ""Incredible"" though implies it should stand out, which it never did to me.

Direction: With a plot this simple, I really cannot see many directors *not* ""delivering what it set out to do."" Not saying he did not do a good job, or that his own personal style did not heavily influence the film, but again I don't understand why so many people treat the direction here as godlike.

Cast: Hardy could have been any actor and it would have made no difference. I have no complaints over him, but Max as a character is hardly a difficult role. Charlize, great, I agree. Supporting cast, great, I agree.

Design: Great, I agree. Exceptional worldbuilding!

Editing: The movie made sense and flowed well. Again, with a plot this simple, I do not see this as a particularly marvelous accomplishment.

Again, these are just my opinions! I am not saying they're right or better than the general consensus. This is just my point of view on it. My biggest gripe is probably the plot, which the average person seemed to think was incredible, whereas I thought it was *at the absolute best,* serviceable. When measured up against other action movies, it does not stand out in the least. The strongest element was the worldbuilding to me, by a mile. Remarkable job on that aspect. :)",1

"It is a denouement. It's supposed to be a final act after the climax. I also hear people complain about movies that have extended denouements compared to the typical hollywood film, and I don't understand it. 

Some films don't need a drawn out denouement and still be perfect, like Die Hard, but ideally the climax shouldn't be right before the end, because then there's usually not enough time for a proper conclusion to the narrative that will actually reinforce the film's themes. 

I think people are acclimated to conventional film screenplays that always leave the biggest action scenes for last, believing that to be the climax, but traditionally in literature and theatre (and properly written screenplays), the climax is almost always closer to the middle. I find it refreshing to see films that actually feel like they make full use of a three or five act structure, so I relish in films like Django Unchained.",0

I just looked it up though and the article I read said to do ""deep cleaning"" (where you actually take everything out and wipe it all down) seasonally. So two months isn't bad there.

What is that reason? Some would argue that it is because the are people who believe that youth under 18 shouldn't know anything about sex or sexuality. They may also consider such places to be perverse.

&gt;...isn't being overly sexual a sign of being sexually abused? Like ya kids start exploring at that age but I feel sex toys pushes it a bit too far.

Not really. It needs to be considered within an environmental context. The child is likely learning about sex in school and is curious. This is a sensitive period, and not a good time to shame them (if there is one).

&gt;Also if a 6th grader told her teacher or someone she trusted that her parents were buying her sex toys, CPS would be getting involved.

There may be questions since it isn't the norm. A social worker would want to determine the circumstances of the matter, but there wouldn't be an apprehension for allowing a child to explore their sexual development in a healthy way.",1

For Math chalk is much nicer to me. Math lectures usually have 6-9 boards at the front and with whiteboards that just isn't nice.

"Once again, I ask how I'm ignorant?  No major religion, including Orthodox Judaism, is against vaccination. In fact, most take the stance that vaccinations are a moral imperative in order to protect not just one's children, but also other people who can't be vaccinated.

That means there has to be more going on here beyond the faith angle (other than the fact this community is tight-knit and spend a lot of time together, thereby increasing chances for disease transmission).  If you spend any time intercting with antivaxers on social media, you will see a very common link: they espouse bodily purity, ""clean"" eating and anything ""natural"": organic food, essential oils, chiropractic and homeopathy, that sort of thing.  All of that is out of reach for many low income households, as is traveling overseas (linked to the current NY outbreak) and going to theme parks (2015 Disneyland outbreak).

In the end, it is extremely privileged and selfish to refuse to take on the responsibility (and minimal risk) of vaccinating one's children while relying on herd immunity to do the job.  It is privileged for parents to deny their children the protection they more than likely themselves received as children.  It is privileged to bask in the luxury of vaccine refusal while parents in developing countries are desperate to vaccinate their children.",1

As an outsider it's insane to watch you Americans talk about everything else but the guns. Yes mental health is an issue, an even bigger issue is the rampant bullying and mean evil culture young people deem acceptable so long as violence isn't used.


You guys need a complete ban on semi Auto weapon and a huge change more like Australia or England to all firearms. 

Yes if someone wants to kill they use other methods but ease of availability and ease of use put guns at number one. I would bet my life the amount of mass murders that have happened in the last decade would be a drastically lower number if ten years ago these changes were strictly implemented. There is no denying this. Yes the black market exists but your average bullied loner, scorned lover or extreme ideolog doesn't hang with criminals and can't usually get an assault rifle from them.

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

so a semi famous singer in my country was planning on doing a music video and wanted around 200 people to star in it. you just had to send in a 2/5 minute video on why you wanted to be chosen and they could pick you. 

my friend hates this singer and joked about trying to get in by faking a fan video so he can look super unimpressed and ruin the video, I thought it was a joke. turns out it's not and he somehow managed to get in.  I've seen the video and he did a good job. 

my issue is that he took a place away from someone that was a fan just to be a dick. 

I asked him what he will do when he filming the video and meeting the singer, he said that he will act super uncomfortable and unimpressed and try and ruin it. 
I got kinda annoyed and told him he was a asshole for doing that and he could of just ignored the competition. 

he is now refusing to speak to me because I'm not finding his joke funny. 

AITA?

"Hispanic here. Born and raised in California. The problem with fresh over the border Mexicans is that they're told by their education system and government that California is rightfully theirs and that it was ""stolen"" from them by America. That's where the entitled attitude stems. They see nothing wrong with crossing over illegally because in their mind they just want a better future on a "" land that was theirs first "".

With all that being said, yes many and i mean many Hispanics are good, hard working, family oriented people who want a better life. However, many are also politically ignorant and have been repeatedly told that the Republican party is the racist party and Democrats are the ones that help the minorities. Also the biased Hispanic news media ( looking at you univision ) furthers this non sense. 

Since many of them can barely speak a lick of English they watch univison as its one of few spanish speaking tv programs available. My parents are a good example of brainwashing by Mexican media. Anyways i hope this sheds some light on the topic. Any more questions feel free to ask.",0

Or are we saying she can’t possibly enjoy her work (we all know women hate sex). 

So yes it is exploitative to sell your body in a capitalist society no one has made the argument otherwise. The real question is what are you defining as sex therapy?

"Haven’t really seen you play that much in all honesty (except for a couple of games), but my point mainly and maybe I didn’t really make myself clear enough, is that you created absolutely nothing yesterday. Some headers and a shit ton of crosses and that’s about it.  

Llorente’s strength exploited our physical weakness and was the reason we couldn’t play our regular game. The thing is playing Llorente doesn’t lead to a lot of defensive problems, as we have seen yesterday. Adding Son to the game Spurs are more likely to keep the ball low and that will only be a good thing for Ajax, because that means we can play our usual game, to press high and force you to make errors.

You could play both Llorente and Son, but in my humble opinion you just won’t have enough attacking power to beat this Ajax and you could, like you said, just wait for that one opening and strike, but that is just playing a low risk low reward game, Ajax will just drive you towards the side lines like they did yesterday and force you to give the cross. The fact is that you are 1-0 down and you need to score and take some risks. 

So playing with Llorente won’t give you enough attacking power and playing with only Son will make you play a game where Ajax mostly will have the upper hand. 

I just don’t see it happening, especially with Ajax playing at home, with a beautiful crowd behind them who make them work for every ball.",0

It’s not so much about hiding information or censorship as it is not actively spreading and victimizing them. You’re taking it to the extreme when you say it would be hidden. I’m not talking about coverups but news outlets always have bias because they choose what’s important to include and what’s not. These situations should be about the victims and preventing it in the future and not about the shooter. Regardless of previous situation it’s inexcusable to do anything close to what they do. The goal should be to stop it before it happens because obviously these people have problems but once they’ve done it at least my sympathy goes out the window.,0

Maybe if it came to the conclusion that the worst teams were any of the Boston teams, or the St. Louis Cardinals, or the Yankees -- those are teams that Deadspin loves to hate on -- you might be on to something.  If anything, I feel like the author went through the effort of working the story -- collecting the data, trying (and failing) to collect the data on the other 38 cities in North America that have Big Four sports teams, compiling all that data -- and deciding ""fuck it, I did all that work, I'm gonna publish it"" rather than letting the story die.

I don't think this is a case of actively distorting facts to fit a preconceived narrative, other than maybe ""there's probably some interesting data in the change in 911 calls!""

*editing to add that I just realized this is a freelancer who pitched this story to Deadspin, not a staff writer.  Makes sense that he'd wring a story out of numbers that don't really have a story to tell, if the alternative is to spike it and not get paid for the effort put into pulling the numbers.*",0

If they were confined to a community with no kids they could work within that community paying their own rent without the lifetime of torture or millions in taxpayer burden.

"&gt; There are a lot of misconceptions about these women that are holding them back. People think they've slept with 1000's of men, that they likely have diseases, that they are criminals, that they are probably drug addicts who have become somewhat violent and dangerous as a survival mechanism and have lost touch with the moral norms of society... These are all true,

I married a woman who lied about her history and what she had been up to for most of her life. Believe me, she hid it quite well. There were clues I missed because I lacked context and experience but just the same, from time to time in the year and a half I knew her before getting married she occasionally let slip comments that a more knowledgeable person would have or could have picked up on. Tracing back to through her history and occasional comments, hiring a PI to follow her around when I wasn't home and literally catching her in the act, I had to face the fact she had been a prostitute and still was an active prostitute. She secretly continued using drugs which I found out when I had to call an ambulance after an overdose and her son retrieved the barbiturate container which we showed EMS so they could treat her effectively, and then she blamed me for causing her to use drugs. She would become violent for no particular reason, she was a chronic and skilled liar, she defrauded the immigration system to get here and in the end was hit with an annulment based on fraud and deported with her son. She did lose touch with any form of ethics and social norms. It's not that she didn't know what right and wrong was, she just didn't care. To her, she didn't mind doing anything so long as she wasn't caught. When caught, she declared I was stupid with all my ethics, like, not lying and stealing from family, friends and your spouse. Oh, and not seeing the benefits of prostitution and getting into her ""business"". Even the judge slammed her on these issues. Oh, she talked so sweet and sounded so nice, like the sweet little victim as her attorney fell for her sweet talk and defended her enthusiastically. On the last day of hearings when we brought out all the documents that showed she was lying to everyone including the federal government her own attorney finally realized how badly he'd been misled. He actually believed her. I even felt a bit of pity for him when in utter disgust he threw his carefully thought out notes on the table in disgust. As for her, I felt no pity when I saw the look of shock on her face as the judge granted me annulment based on fraud and slammed his gavel down. Everything she had worked and schemed for destroyed in that moment. I didn't even feel bad when I learned she had been deported. She had her chance and blew it. You can take the whore off the streets but you can't make a whore into a wife or a respectable citizen. The only misconception  here is thinking there are misconceptions. No, society has this right.",1

"&gt; ...which is the same as doping. How is it fair to other competitors if she were allowed to run?

It isn't, because she isn't doping. I hate this idea of fair in sports, because so long as you aren't cheating, things aren't meant to be fair. That's why some people are better than others.

I, and many others, have a problem with how the WW and others have been built up with mystery and tension for the last decade, leaving the audience with massive questions on a cosmic scale, and not answering or satisfying them in the slightest. 

The show has just implied he's evil because he's evil. He's the embodiment of the dichotomy the show and books are meant to oppose.

"To your point, it’s interesting to note that the “original” first-person shooter video games (Wolfenstein 3D and Doom) were released in 1992 and 1993 respectively. These titles were revolutionary and made the entire “shooter” genre very popular. By the late 90s (when Columbine occurred), the games had become much more common, realistic and violent. To this day, First-person shooter games such as Call of Duty or Halo are among the most popular video games in America. 

Is it purely coincidental that young males started shooting their classmates shorty after we literally turned shooting people into a game? Many of the shooters have been reported to be avid fans of games of that genre. 

To expand upon this idea, I think it’s important to see that our problem with shootings in America is far to broad and complex to blame on any one issue. It is a combination of a fascination with murderers; a 24 hour news cycle that is desperate for ratings; a society that has become desensitized to violence through violent movies/shows/games; a worship of the military creating “wannabe soldiers”; a poor public education system; a poor mental health system;  and, yes, the wide availability of firearms. 

Many other factors work in as well, those are just some of the larger ones. Point is, there is no single issue to blame. Frequent shootings, be it gang violence, active shooters, accidents or suicides are a uniquely American problem due to a culmination of other unique American problems.",1
"As long as there's demand, which there is, the stock should be at least $243",0
"The undead attacked in a way they did not expect. At Hardhome and the Frozen Lake the wights moved as a disorganized mass. There were many gaps and spaces in the horde, and they moved fairly slowly until the saw the living, at that point they rushed forward in an uncoordinated manner, focusing on the first target they saw whilst ignoring those further back. All the tactics they used were based on that assumption. The artillery that preceded the Dothraki charge was intended to open further holes in the mass. The Dothraki would have exploited the gaps in the wight walker army,  riding forward and hacking with their dragonglass arakhs. They then could have either reformed and charged again, or gone after the White Walkers if they saw them. Similarly, the Unsullied would have been effective against the undead rushing forward and attacking the first person they saw as they would have remained in close-formation and killed the wights as they haphazardly came forward. If that was not sufficient, then the fire-trench would have held back the undead, exposing them to missile fire. It was clearly stated in the previous episode that the intention was to use the army massed in front of Winterfell to hold off the undead long enough to draw in the Night King and kill him. The intention was never to wipe out the wight army just by itself.

The problem was the undead moved and attacked in a way they had never witnessed. They were not a shambling mass anymore. They would no longer break ranks and run forward separately just to grapple the enemy. Now they moved and attacked as one coordinated organism. And they did so with an incredible level of speed that turned them into a tsunami of decaying bodies that did not stop. Where the wights would pile onto the nearest living thing, now they surged forward and kept on going, one after the other. Yes, it is easy to state what the defenders should have done *after the fact*. But, based on what the characters had previously experienced, and their existing knowledge of how  the undead fought, all their decisions were sensible at the time.",0
"Not really. Even 5 year olds that have a grasp of the English language will cry over minor pain or something

"That is making alot of assumptions about his character, leadership skills, and ideas. You have no idea what his plans are or what his ideas are for helping advocate for these women. Just because he is a man does not mean he cnt do this job. You are saying because of his gender he is unable to do something? Ironic as that is something this club is pushing against. Just because he wants to president doesnt mean the club will revolve around him. A good president and leader will make the club revolve around the mission of the club and not themselves. In addition there are no women wanting to stand up to fill this position, so would it be better to have the club dissolve with no leadership or have a leader that cares about the mission but happens to be male.",1
Fair. I'm more or less weirdly pissed from his POV on a weird hypothetical.,1
"They put themselves into that no leverage situation and managed to scrape out a late 2nd worth of capital in 2020. It's good that they got something out of it instead of keeping around 2 QBs to make the situation toxic, but turning pick #15 overall, a 3rd and a 5th in the 2018 draft into a 2019 2nd and a 2020 5th is a really bad return. You can't do that and then give yourself props for getting a top 35 player on your draft board as if you couldn't have done that much easier with the 3 or so top 35 overall 2020 picks worth of capital they spent on Rosen. The other 3 picks were earned by being the worst team in the league not as anything to do with the Rosen trade so pointing to them as if they're an accomplishment instead of proof of bottom tier suckage is also weird.",0
"You're right, that was probably the reason they underplayed his powers. Could have given him more to do though, IMO.",0
"If we're talking about realism, like so many of us care about here, those fights would never happen. Past has shown the WW can be defeated, so obviously they wouldn't want to face these valyrian steel swordsmen head on. 

On the other had you have many other scenes that are just plain unrealistic (people getting overwhelmed by wights and still surviving, wights attacking one at a time etc.). Makes you think about how we couldn't get a WW vs. Human fight instead.",0

I mean that's not all. They share the exact same past up to a point too. If they just shared only the same biology they would be a clone, but they share more than that because they're the same character.

&gt;Yeah, that sounds exactly like how I described.

So you're taking one moment where he shows he's going to look for the person he loved and assuming the entire story around it? That's so pointless and ignorant. What is there to gain from that?

"Talking to someone that is friends with her may be hard, but it is possible they would still be available for some of the other issues going on in your life. I guess it might depend on which one they are more friends with. If they met you through her, or if they met you and then became friends with her. It's worth a try if you feel they would be there and could listen. Being a social worker may have the positive side of you knowing more resources available to you and which ones are helpful. I understand it could feel hard being the one seeking help when you are the one people normally come to, but that's okay. A lot of therapists have therapist, social workers use services, etc. There is no shame in that. I know reaching out takes some work. It makes us vulnerable and that's hard. There are people there for you and who want to help you. 

I'm glad you picked to talk about it on here instead of the bridge. That takes a lot of strength and courage. Small steps are the best way to get anywhere. They may be little but you are still moving forward and before you know it you'll see some improvements. It might feel like it will never happen and then next thing you know, there's all this progress. Things don't have to get perfect and they may never, but they can change and they can get better than today. 

If you aren't comfortable with medications, that is okay. There are other forms of therapy. Talking is one that can help, but there is also cognitive behavioral, mindfulness based, EMDR, guided self-help, nature based, support groups, etc. There are many types these days and they don't need to involve any medications. However, it also sounds like those medications just weren't right for you. The numbness and suicidal feelings are common side effects, but usually when we experience side effects it is a sign a different medication might be better like how if you developed a rash, you'd use a different one. I don't know what your situation was with that. Maybe the therapist thought the good outweighed those side effects. It could be a matter of unfortunately trying out different ones and seeing if one worked better. Again, that isn't the only option. I tried antidepressants at one point in my life and they made me feel like I was having a heart attack and going to die, and I've never wanted to risk that again so I completely understand just opting to never use them and try other therapies instead. 

Rejection is hard. It is painful and there is no way around that. However, it really does seem like there are some unhealthy things about her. Poor communication and not letting you in on what is wrong, putting you down and bringing up all your flaws, not being balanced in a sense that she can do things but not you. I don't think she is treating you well. You don't deserve to be treated like that. I think it is great you take accountability for your wrongs and all people should. I'm not saying what you did isn't wrong. But we have a choice in how we react and I think her choice of reaction is harmful in this situation. Does she know how much you are going through?",0

"What makes me laugh are these 'parallels' and 'foreshadowing' people are forcing now... 'Remember in season 2 when Arya said she doesn't like being cold? she knew she would kill the guy who brings it already, brilliant writing D&amp;D'. Like literally pulling in anything to make this episode make any logical sense, which of course it doesn't.

The show writers think people love game of thrones for the twists, turns and elements of surprise which is true. The only difference is, George's elements of surprise had a meaning, an action could be followed by a consequence because of unpredictability of human nature and it made logical sense. With the show now, it's more like 'how can we surprise them now... oh i know, lets just disregard what we said previously, they won't expect that!'.",0
"OK, so this 12-year-old now knows that her dad cheated and is a shitty person. Now what? She’s going to be living with him for the next six years at least, she’s going to be emotionally invested in him likely for the rest of his life, while OP is basically going to be out of her life after this. 

What’s the actual benefit in her knowing the details of this? “Your dad is a shithead who cheated, btw bye see you never!” Great, so the child loses a person who was in her life, and now potentially thinks terribly of and doesn’t trust her actual parent. That’s just perfect! Where do things go from here? Surely up, for those rosy teenage years when nothing ever goes wrong!

OP basically got to drop a bomb and walk out in the aftermath. I am in no way justifying what happened to her. It completely sucks that this person she loved cheated on her, and what the dad did is complete shit. However, it’s not like OP is going to be around to do anything for this kid in the future. So setting fire to the dad‘s relationship with the daughter, doesn’t really accomplish anything except hurting the child.

"&gt; Right now you have a president that is doing everything he said he was going to do which was the reason people voted for him in the first place. 

Most of his supporters voted for him because:

1. His last name isn't Clinton
2. He's not a Democrat
3. He's not black

They would have voted for anyone who met those qualifications. The rest voted for him because they had something to gain from a Republican in the White House.

Whether he's doing what people voted for him to do is a matter of debate, but he's definitely hurting the working-class people who voted for him in order to help the wealthy. He's such a shitty leader that even with all 3 branches of government under GOP control, the only major legislative victory in 2 years was a tax scam passed under the guise of budget reconciliation. A tax scam that is fucking over the middle class working folks who voted for him. Now we're in a trade war that is fucking over the middle class working folks, including the agriculture industry.

"The MCAS won't re-enable itself once the trim cutoff disables it. The issue is that once the MCAS trims the plane nose-down the whole way, aerodynamic forces on the tail make it difficult to move the trim wheels to mechanically center the trim. 

Supposedly, the plane was trimmed nose-down by the MCAS system, they disabled the trim motors, found they couldn't retrim the aircraft manually because of the aerodynamic forces, so they reactivated the motors to trim it back up. MCAS, now re-enabled, continued to trim the aircraft back down again and dove the aircraft into the ground.

In order to trim the aircraft when aerodynamic forces on the tail make it difficult/impossible to turn the trim wheels, the pilots need to unload the forces on the tail by momentarily allowing the plane to fly ""as trimmed"" without any stick input from the pilots, quickly wind the trim wheels in the desired direction, then re-assert control and pull the aircraft back up. Repeat the maneuver as desired until the plane can be trimmed normally. The pilots flying the aircraft weren't trained in this maneuver.

https://www.satcom.guru/2019/04/stabilizer-trim-loads-and-range.html

Note:

MCAS can override the pilot's electric trim inputs (the oft-repeated ""MCAS re-enabling/reactivating itself""), but once disabled using the trim cutout, the electric motors that drive the trim are disabled and MCAS cannot trim the aircraft and cannot re-enable itself. In this configuration the trim is completely manual.",0

"First, this article is bunk because no matter whether a president can or can't be indicted, Mueller was never going to stray from DOJ policy.

Second, a sitting president can't be indicted. The executive branch is in charge of carrying out and enforcing the laws Congress creates. if a president committed a crime, ultimately it would fall to that very same president, as the highest level of authority of the executive branch, to decide whether or not to indict and prosecute that case. 

Seems like most presidents would just excuse their own crimes since they'd have that self autonomy.

Which is why they have the check of the House being able to impeach a charge and the Senate then convicting, with subsequent removal from office.

I'm pretty sure that our original government framers were capable of seeing the ridiculousness of what would be the president prosecuting himself essentially.

What they definitely didn't see becoming a reality is Congress becoming a corporately sponsored hyper partisan body that over the years regularly grinds to a halt on a regular basis due to disagreements across party lines.",1

"I felt bad for you at first but then you literally shred her culture into pieces. 

Dowry in Chinese culture is not a law but tradition.  Husbands also often help out with wife's family.  You may not want to follow that, which is completely fine, but it sound like you don't actually know the Chinese family cultures and traditions. 

There is no fucking law against dowry in Canada. It is not illegal, just not recognized by law all the time in the specific cultural senses (which depends on the culture) but there has been court ruling to include a dowry.

In Chinese culture, dowry is made to the bride's family by the husband, not the other way round. And if a couple split, wife can still be rewarded a split of networth of the husband, or the other way round, for that matter.

I had property before I married but I recognize that once I get married, my husband can get a share of my networth/property. I love him and am happy to share ny life and everything in it with him. There is nothing wrong with having a pre-nup, but I wonder what tone of voice you used when discussing the topic.

&gt;She does not own any property, why was she doing research on how property is divided during a divorce. It should be me that is the one doing the research. I did not even know about this until recently but she knew it all along.

"Feminism *is* about hating men tho, the fact that they are factually correct is not really relevant. Just like how white supremacist can say that black women lead the nation in obesity and STD rates. It may be factually true, but their *objective* is to spread race based hatred. The same is true here, men obviously are more aggressive and are more violent, but femanazis only use that truth in their efforts to spread hatred and fear. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Hate Facts"" as they are known are always a ""carriage in front of the horse"" type of deal. You have to look at what a persons agenda is when you are analyzing their argument. The media railing against men is indeed an attack on men, their hate-facts are just a weapon so it doesnt matter if theyre true. Femanazis agenda includes spreading gender based fear and hatred - so I say fuck them cows.",1

"I think there's a delicate balance that needs to be maintained between logical character choices and what makes good TV. I think if Arya just silently snuck up behind him and stabbed him in the back, that likely would have also been perceived as anticlimactic. The jump out of the darkness really gives the moment excitement and is amazing to watch in slow motion. Plus, I'm convinced Arya needed to stab the NK in the heart through the front of his chest in the same manner he was created in order for him to die, so the writers essentially needed her to do something that would make him turn around, hence the yell. I think you could probably argue that a guttural yell of rage may have actually been quite natural / involuntary in that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The same could be said for the complaints regarding the strategies used during the battle. Yes, in real life, maybe the wights and WWs could have easily just surrounded Winterfell and starved everyone out. Maybe they could have sent another WW henchman to fetch Bran and bring him to the NK. Maybe Dany could have slowly and methodically burned up bunches of wights while Jon guarded Bran.

"Sorry for the late reply - I completely agree with what you said.  I was surprised that the R&amp;R Express were part of the tournament, and worried that the Briscoes would lose to them somehow.

That said, holy shit, the match was a lot crazier than I thought it would be - especially when Ricky Morton hit a hurricanrana.  I was worried when it happened as it looked like he bent his head and neck in the process.  For their age those dudes put on a great match though - it's worrisome to watch but cheers to them for being badass enough to do that sort of thing at 60+.

I can fully relate to feeling negatively conditioned by WWE regarding match quality, and just started branching out to other promotions for that reason (although I absolutely love NXT).  I actually just bought an ROH subscription for the first time as I've wanted to be able to go back and watch the earlier stuff of people like Adam Cole, Roddy, Kyle O'Reilly, etc.

I was watching Impact for a little bit before it switched off Destination America, and it was my first introduction to Tessa Blanchard.  In just one or two matches she became and continues to be my favorite women's wrestler. I haven't caught Impact since the switch as it's no longer on TV in my area but will plan to start doing so on Twitch.  Do you know if previous episodes are available to watch for free on Impact's Twitch channel, or do they only show the newest one?

But yeah, Tessa Blanchard, goddamn. I am in awe of her.  Haven't seen the Rebellion match yet but hope to soon.  Did you buy the PPV?  Would have liked to but I already have paid subscriptions for the WWE Network and ROH, so I try to avoid going too crazy with more wrestling purchases (but I should do it more often anyway, even if just to support alternatives to WWE).",0

"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically. 

Peoples misconception of the arcs and mixing that with theories they’ve heard and prophecies they’ve taken either literally or misinterpreted is the problem here more than bad writing",1

"Ask him to explain what was funny about it. That makes it a good, funny joke. That's always an interesting question to ask when someone tells an offensive joke. 

Sometimes, the replies can help you realise... yeah, it was said with an innocent attitude. The content may have been offensive in some contexts, but the joke didn't come from an offensive place, and wasn't funny just because it could possibly cause offense. 

But sometimes you realise they only found the joke funny because they think being assholes to groups of people is a funny thing, and have terrible attitudes towards the people who the 'joke' caused offense to.

So ask, see what his reply is, and make up your mind from that. It's the attitude behind offensive jokes that matters on an individual level. His attitude towards your daughter is what really matters here - right now she doesn't understand, so its fine, but if he has a bad attitude that could hurt her when she *does* understand... welp, that's a problem.

If he refuses to explain or gets pissed at you asking, then you can probably safely say that it came from an offensive place and he doesn't like being questioned about it. People who don't mean to be assholes tend to like to clear it up and explain their innocent intentions, if someone thinks they *have* been an asshole. They don't WANT people to feel sad, or offended, because they're *not* an asshole, and so are happy to change your opinion of them and stop you feeling sad. 

If they don't care that you're sad and offended and feeling bad because of them, then yep... they're an asshole. People will apologise if they accidentally stand on your toe, because they feel bad for hurting you even if they far from meant to do that... unless, of course, they're an asshole.",0

"&gt;The responses are crazy. There is a reason why sex stores only sell to 18+

What is that reason? Some would argue that it is because the are people who believe that youth under 18 shouldn't know anything about sex or sexuality. They may also consider such places to be perverse.

&gt;...isn't being overly sexual a sign of being sexually abused? Like ya kids start exploring at that age but I feel sex toys pushes it a bit too far.

Not really. It needs to be considered within an environmental context. The child is likely learning about sex in school and is curious. This is a sensitive period, and not a good time to shame them (if there is one).

&gt;Also if a 6th grader told her teacher or someone she trusted that her parents were buying her sex toys, CPS would be getting involved.

There may be questions since it isn't the norm. A social worker would want to determine the circumstances of the matter, but there wouldn't be an apprehension for allowing a child to explore their sexual development in a healthy way.",1

YTA for the way you handled that.,1
Pretty guy with pretty cat,1
"First, you have to separate two kinds of succession here: by force and by right.

By force is simple, whoever is strong enough to dethrone the current ruling family can become the ruling family, as long as they have the realms backing.

By right is what is suppose to be the default when a family is already ruling.

The Targaryens lost the right to succession because they were removed forcefully. So even if the realm accepts Jon is a Targaryen, he doesn't necessarily have the right to the throne any longer, his grandfather was overthrown. This rule also applies to Dany, given Jon doesn't tell anyone and/or gives up his claim to rule. 

So, we have succession by right from the ruling family. Tyrion is a traitor to the realm. So prolly not him. Jaime, through vows, has renounced his right to rule (although, there is some murkiness to this). So, since Cercei has no kids and her siblings seem to be on the outside looking in, it should technically check Cerceis Uncles first. We know Kevan is dead, but I don't know if Tywin had any other siblings. After that... well it becomes troublesome. They could look to extended family through Robert Baratheon, if the Lannister's can't find a suitable heir. 

That scenario though actually helps both Dany and Jon. The weaker the claim by the ruling family, the better chance other claims have to be pushed (like Dany and Jon being from the previous royal family). 

Honestly, the rules have already been muddied up by Cercei. Technically, after Tommen died, they should have search Robert's family first before Cercei's. Bobby B's brothers are gone, so they'd still check his uncles first before Cercei just taking the crown. She was a queen through marriage, not blood.",0

Should be the other way around,1
"It’s true. Businesses have pervaded the election process. 

The Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) struck down the bipartisan campaign reform act (2002) and overruled the previous precedent Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). The latter 2 limiting corporate campaign donations.

This Supreme Court case has effectively given corporations and labor unions recognization as individuals under the 1st amendment in political speech. More and more money is being funneled into the campaign process each year. There is a radicalization of political ideals and obligation of candidates. A venture that has expounded the reflective properties of the media within the face of its subjective voters.

On the topic of the post however, we are painted a very vivid and diametric image. This is very complex series of events that often need more than money on both sides. 

Everyone seems to think the 1% comprises of billionaires. However, the real number is around 400 thousand dollars. This is a very important distinction. The top 10% of the population is very common and a large percentage of the us population will reach that point during their life. In fact, with a retiring baby boomer industry, you have tremendous opportunity right now. 

My point is, everyone thinks Lamborghini when they hear wealthy. They don’t see the mortgages or the amount of money reinvested into your built from scratch company. That is a completely different group of people. That is the top .001%. So when you hear Bernie shouting to tax the 1%, picture the 75 hours a week, reduced life span from stress and focused individuals.

Now imagine the American dream, rising up without a hedge-fund and employing 50 people. You put 6 days a week into this job. You live eat and sleep it. Your marriage is crashing but you’re pushing through. Your life is this company. You are constantly dealing with risks, you could go from profitable to bankrupt in a number of weeks. You make 400k a year. Now imagine being taxed 35%. You’re now making 260k and employing 50 people with weekly payroll expense of 40k. You make sacrifices for this check. Just imagine that if you will! 160k each year in taxes on wage alone! Your overall tax rate is probably half! 

Now philosophically, is that dollar amount worth your life? When would it be worth it to work away so your kids have it easy? Let’s consider where we would be if we didn’t have control over what we produce. What would this new cost benefit analysis do to the comforts of your life now? 

What do I suggest? I agree we should tax, but it should be sliding to a determined amount that would allow competition to be born not stifled. That is to say, realistically, if you make 400k a year, should Bernie tax you 90% of your wages as he suggested?At the moment, competition is stifled in many industries by a barrier of entry.

The theory of economics is a completely different story at this point. I encourage you to shoot me down.

Edit: I have been corrected on 2 fronts. 

1. I did not include marginal taxation of brackets. 

2. Bernie Sanders is not endorsing a 90% tax rate, it is a myth propagated by fringe groups. On that note, it appears he has reasonable tax brackets. Here is an unofficial website displaying his tax plan according to information released on his website. http://www.bernietax.com/#0;0

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

 &gt;I’m not a controlling or old fashioned boyfriend and I put aside a lot of personal convictions for the sake of being an accepting and loving s/o to my girlfriend of almost a year.
&gt;
&gt;Today, she put a picture of her and her friend popping their asses towards the camera with a caption talking about their asses. This is not something she would normally do so it came by me as surprising.

&gt;I asked her about it in a very non confrontational and non-sexist way, mainly stating that it’s somewhat bothersome to me to be publicly sharing something like that especially when she’s a relatively sought-after girl in our peer group. I pointed out that it sends somewhat of a message to former lovers and guys who are into her. 
&gt;
&gt;She immediately got defensive and said that it’s her body and social media to choose what to do with and I agreed that, yes, the decision is ultimately hers, I would hope that she would afford me the same respect that I know I would give her in the same situation.

"There really isnt a point in buying new sports games each year. I wish companies would release new games every 2 years, with the off year selling a ""roster update"" for people if they want it. I feel like one year isnt enough to develop a lot of new stuff, so you get the same game with some slight tweaks, a new game mode or 2(but not the ones people actually want), and thats it. With 2 years to develop a game you could see actual changes i think.

Take madden for example. You have the same basic buggy, glitchy, animation driven(sometimes disregarding user input) gameplay being rehased every year. One year between games isnt enough time to actually fix the underlying problems so they throw sprinkles and syrup on top as if it makes the shit taste any better.

However, since nobody needs to play a game when it first comes out(that goes for any game, not just sports), just wait a few months until its on sale. Sports games will always go on sale, and much faster than any other genre. I own 3 edition of football manager(12, 13 and 18) and have paid less than 50 dollars total for them.",0

Also, that's what I'm talking about. Why the fuck are rape scenes becoming so normal?

These are two shows. They're becoming more present in shows that depict dark and dystopian settings.

&gt; Shit is disgusting and not necessary. In the good old days they just alluded to it.

So you're okay with just *hearing about it in the background*, but not *experiencing it*. That it should be hidden away behind the conventional violence and torture. If you're building a setting about a dark, despotic and disturbing world - to disinclude sexual violence as a product of that would be disingenuine.

In regards to GoT: I see no reason to incorporate torture and show torture porn from a variety of tribes, whilst inexplicably airbrushing the possibility of rape by any individual(s), or factions. Part of the grim world that George made is that this is what war is, and in the books he provides in-depth descriptions of scattered and bloodstained battlegrounds, abandoned villages and the psychological effects it has on the surviving soldiers.

&gt;So and so was raped, now to the meat of the show. I don't want to watch people get fake raped for entertainment. It's fucking weird.

I'd argue having rape as a mere afterthought of someone's backstory or character path is much worse than just depicting it and confronting it.",0

Yeah people straight lie about the show to make the last couple seasons sound worse than they are. Both in the show and books there’s always been the heroic Starks and the villainous Lannisters/Freys/Boltons/Others.

The amount of people that came out in support of the opposition was tiny, only a dozen soldiers actually defected and Guaido still had the nerve to call for the uprising, basically, willing to throw unarmed humans on professional well-armed soldiers. 

Maduro is a shitty leader but as Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Iraq have proved of the last two decades a shitty leader is better than a failed state and a civil war. 

He should act now and jail all the opposition leaders, he has a perfect excuse for that – calling for an uprising and a military coup is not how democracy should work. 

Maduro is authoritarian, sure, but opposition not only have proved to lack popular support but demonstrated its readiness to use violence as a toll.",1

"First, this article is bunk because no matter whether a president can or can't be indicted, Mueller was never going to stray from DOJ policy.

Second, a sitting president can't be indicted. The executive branch is in charge of carrying out and enforcing the laws Congress creates. if a president committed a crime, ultimately it would fall to that very same president, as the highest level of authority of the executive branch, to decide whether or not to indict and prosecute that case. 

Seems like most presidents would just excuse their own crimes since they'd have that self autonomy.

Which is why they have the check of the House being able to impeach a charge and the Senate then convicting, with subsequent removal from office.

I'm pretty sure that our original government framers were capable of seeing the ridiculousness of what would be the president prosecuting himself essentially.

What they definitely didn't see becoming a reality is Congress becoming a corporately sponsored hyper partisan body that over the years regularly grinds to a halt on a regular basis due to disagreements across party lines.",1

What’s the actual benefit in her knowing the details of this? “Your dad is a shithead who cheated, btw bye see you never!” Great, so the child loses a person who was in her life, and now potentially thinks terribly of and doesn’t trust her actual parent. That’s just perfect! Where do things go from here? Surely up, for those rosy teenage years when nothing ever goes wrong!

OP basically got to drop a bomb and walk out in the aftermath. I am in no way justifying what happened to her. It completely sucks that this person she loved cheated on her, and what the dad did is complete shit. However, it’s not like OP is going to be around to do anything for this kid in the future.

On the same day the memo was sent, newly released emails now show HSI officials scrambling to find cases that would justify family separation to provide Nielsen ahead of an appearance before lawmakers.

Email exchanges between the CPS and its Swedish counterparts over the high-profile case were deleted after the lawyer at the UK end retired in 2014. The destruction of potentially sensitive and revealing information comes ahead of a tribunal hearing in London next week.* **Adding to the intrigue, it emerged the CPS lawyer involved had, unaccountably, advised the Swedes in 2010 or 2011 not to visit London to interview Assange. An interview at that time could have prevented the long-running embassy standoff.""**

If he did do this, this is a huge deal breaker for me. Not only because he betrayed your trust, but there is a huge possiblity he just fucked her and she's calling it sperm donation. Also, he mentions she's ""emotionally unstable"" and ""suicidal"". So uh, why is he *willingly* giving this lady a fucking child? Oh wait, maybe she's just a bitchy lady mad that you're dating *her* friend. 

PLEASEEEEE dump him. Not only did he lie and never mention this to you ( HUGE HUGE HUGEEEE RED FLAG!!!), he's potentially endangering a future child AND getting you on the hook to pay baby Mama's child support. 

Tell him to kick rocks and have fun paying that child support from BM, because she would never get *my* money, honey. 

This is truly an awful situation but I am happy your sister is here for you. Even if he has a legit contract, I would call off the engagement and break up with him because you don't father another child behind your fiancee's back without it being a huge fucking affair or ???? I have no idea why.

Like why the fuck is Ricochet in MITB and Roode is off TV when Roode pinned him last week? Logic gaps like that add up and maybe casual viewers don’t notice specific ones but it’s the reason they aren’t invested in anything that happens. Nothing matters.

And that’s such a simple fucking fix. Plan one week ahead. Book any other match if you have to put Ricochet in MITB, and you don’t want to beat Roode with his new look.",0

"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically. 

Peoples misconception of the arcs and mixing that with theories they’ve heard and prophecies they’ve taken either literally or misinterpreted is the problem here more than bad writing",1

2 soft calls.. its all even.,1
"&gt;Eriksen has been poor for months not just for every couple of games imao. 

Eriksen has been overworked and forced to take on his normal attacking responsibilities in addition to covering for the complete lack of midfield, and during that time he's still managed to be the side's chief creative force and the hub of every period of dominance or positive play.

&gt;And Dele has been steadily regressing as a player for years and has had a really poor season too so far. How many goals has he scored this year? 4? 5? How many chances has created for other players? Did you even watch yesterday's game? Both have been very sub par.

Saying Dele's regressed is just nonsense. Last season was his best, most influential for Spurs yet. He's scoring less because he's simply playing a completely different role - he used to play directly off of Kane, he's been gradually moving deeper into a more conventional attacking midfield role and this season sometimes as an outright central midfielder. He started this season excellently, and until he started picking up niggling injuries he was playing some of his best ever football and was arguably the side's strongest performer. And same as Eriksen, the side just looks infinitely better when he's playing. You keep bringing up yesterday... Neither was bad at all, and when Sissoko came on to shore up the midfield their influence started growing and growing.

&gt;And do you know how hard is it to find versatile players like him who can play in 3-4 different positions? Just because he's plays better in the final third it doesn't mean he's a limited player imao. Imagine Eriksen playing as the focal point of attack. Or Dele. Do you think they will do just as a good job as him? They have different roles within the team, sure but that doesn't mean that somehow Dele and Eriksen are more well rounded players than Son.

Dele has played for Spurs in a double pivot, a midfield 3, as a 10, as a second striker, in a front 3... He's aerially strong in both boxes, he offers a passing outlet to the centre backs, he carries the ball from deep... How can you even suggest Son is as well rounded as him? That is nonsense.  Could Son play next to Wanyama like both these guys have done? Could he be the side's playmaker?


&gt;defensively?? That's why he played as a second right back and left back switching sides in the City game???

No? I don't at all. But I never even said Son doesn't contribute defensively, you've conjured that. He's simply not as effective as the other 2, covers less distance, has less physical presence...",1

What’s the actual benefit in her knowing the details of this? “Your dad is a shithead who cheated, btw bye see you never!” Great, so the child loses a person who was in her life, and now potentially thinks terribly of and doesn’t trust her actual parent. That’s just perfect! Where do things go from here? Surely up, for those rosy teenage years when nothing ever goes wrong!

OP basically got to drop a bomb and walk out in the aftermath. I am in no way justifying what happened to her. It completely sucks that this person she loved cheated on her, and what the dad did is complete shit. However, it’s not like OP is going to be around to do anything for this kid in the future. So setting fire to the dad‘s relationship with the daughter, doesn’t really accomplish anything except hurting the child.

Eh, no. Both North and South America recognize Guaido, except for corrupt Putin puppets of Bolivia and Cuba.

Europe recognizes Guaido, except for Putin puppet Belarus and Serbia.

Australia, Japan and South Korea all support Guaido.

No one really gives a shit about what the dictators in the Middle East thinks.

China, who will lose a shitload of money that they have lend to Maduro, if he fails, obviously recognized Maduro as President.

The rest of the world are either neutral or haven’t made a statement yet.

Every nation who stand behind Maduro have financial connections to him, one way or the other. It’s either via loans or military equipment exports to Venezuela, which will cease to exist if Maduro falls.

They don’t care about the Venezuelan people. All they care about is sustain their own economic flow from Venezuela.",1

That's why I actually changed my mind from always trying to drop safe with randoms to dropping hot.

"Hacks come in all different shapes. This guy probably has a very expensive hack that is most likely using his mouse memory or something that isn't detectable very easily. Anti-Cheat is only good if it can be allowed to be intrusive into your system. Since it's this game is Source engine based there are already plenty of hacks developed for CS:GO that only need to be tweaked slightly to be used in Apex. The only way to be stricter on cheating is to allow a program to scan and monitor your computer and peripherals  for exploits like ESEA Anti-Cheat does. This is why even in CSGO this isn't the standard because the majority of the players don't want a company snooping around their files exposing the 1000 hours of Hentai you have stored in your hard drive, or give a company the opportunity to steal data for you or use resources from your computer, such as mining for crypto. You can't have the cake and eat it too, thats what people have to understand about hacks, the hacker is ALWAYS ahead of the Dev, the Dev is always playing catch up.",0

And for the record, there's nothing wrong with being bi. I think part of the problem is people desperate to deny being bi because they see it as unacceptable. You like jerkin it with other dudes, you're a lil bi, *and that's okay*.

"I’d like to point out something that everyone seems to be skipping. Your daughter’s biological mother is the one who skipped out on Mother’s Day with her child. It’s funny how no one is calling her a cunt or an asshole or saying she’s horrible for not spending Mother’s Day with the child she actually birthed and raised. You don’t even seem upset about that.....but you are angry with your wife, who has only been a step-parent for 3.5 years and only sees your daughters 4 days a month. 

Have you considered that given the length of your marriage and the age of your kids, your daughters likely have never really seen your wife in a motherly role and vice versa? That’s pretty normal. I see it all the time in posts written by step-kids. “I have a mom/dad. I don’t need another one.” “My stepmom is always trying to act like she can tell me what to do.” “My stepdad needs to back off. I don’t need his advice.” Blending families when the kids are preteens and teens doesn’t work like it does when kids are young, especially if Mom or Dad are still fully involved. Parental relationships don’t develop as naturally, if at all. A “fun aunt” or friendly type relation tends to happen in healthy households instead. 

There’s just a lot of information missing from this post. What kind of relationship does your wife have with your daughters? Is she close with them? Has she made overtures? Have they indicated at any time they see her as a mother? Has there been serious tension or bad experiences? Has she been given a motherly role in your daughter’s life? Do you and your ex allow your wife to actually parent? Is she involved in decision making as equally? Would your daughter have wanted to spend Mother’s Day with your wife if her biological mother was available? Has your daughter ever even acknowledged your wife on Mothers day before? 

Depending on the answer to any of those questions, your wife could be being perfectly reasonable or a total asshole. Either way, it’s not particularly fair for you to expect her to “fill-in” because biomom is busy doing something else.",1

* China can't say shit, same reason as Russia.

"This is a bad take imo. You’re not a version of what you hated for wanted someone who did bad to you to experience it themselves(and hopefully provide them with empathy going forward). 

I personally hope the worst for the people that bullied me and I mean that from the heart. I don’t think about it much and it’s not something I bring up or fantasize about, but at the end of the day I had the shit beaten out of me, psychological and emotional damage inflicted on me, and all because of what? They had some problems they couldn’t work out and took it out on someone who couldn’t fight back be it because they did it in numbers or in ways that made it difficult. Naw, seriously, fuck them. 

I think some of what you’re getting at applies to cases where the bullying isn’t as egregious or serious. But for people who were legitimately hurt mentally or physically it doesn’t apply. It’s also hard to tell people that they’re asking for disproportionate amounts of suffering when at the end of the day however many years later it’s clearly still troubling them while at least in my experience nothing negative ever happened to the bullies(a couple got their comeuppance but most never had anything bad happen for them). I can see it as reasonable for a person to wish extreme harm on someone when their life was fucked up(and clearly for a long time) by that person and they by and large suffered no consequences for it.

More than the bullies I hate the systems that enabled them. Their parents, the schools, the police, etc but at the end of the day if the people who mistreated me later suffered greatly I wouldn’t feel much empathy. I’m never going to go out of my way to harm someone, I’m not that kind of person, but I would take joy in those that harmed me being harmed especially if it’s the result of their own actions. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that(although I’m sure many disagree).",0

"My children were born to a single mother. I came upon the scene and married that mother 10 years later. These children are extremely smart and tactful and that has nothing to do with the fact that my wife didn’t abort them. They didn’t live a lavish life as you can imagine growing up in a household of just a single mother money will be tight. One of those girls just won the local spelling bee and has the highest reading level in her grade. Genetics as very little to do with IQ, it is almost completely structural. Kids that are born to parents that have cars and steady jobs and can be there to read to their children at night- those kids will thrive even if they are dumb as a box of rocks. Why? Because children need structure. So yes, abortion is a form of eugenics, but it is only affecting those that are predisposed to getting abortions due to culturally norms, so not just ‘poor’ people and those with a low IQ, because, if you don’t think rich and ‘smart’ people don’t have unprotected sex and need abortions the you are sadly mistaken. Eugenics affects the genetic pool of a society, this doesn’t affect any one group, because all people are predisposed to premarital sex except for potentially the highly religious. This is a straw man that you’ve built and yes, I know this is unpopular opinions, and while opinions shouldn’t be ‘wrong’ or ‘right’ in a vacuum your opinion is just plain factually deficit. 

TLDR: poor people do not have lower IQs due to being poor, they have lower IQs because of their lack to education, resources, proper diet and even just reading materials. Your opinion is based on flawed-logic.",0

"Assuming OP loves in a predominantly English-speaking country like America or England, the age of consent isn't until someone is about 16-18 years old.

""All save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast...

I love a lot of the heroines, and they're strong enough characters on their own that Disney doesn't need to shove their female identity in our faces. In fact, I'd make the argument those two moments reduce those characters to their status as women, to political tools for female empowerment, rather than letting them hold their own as just equal characters. It's counterintuitive to the whole point of gender equality in the first place.",1

"With the huge lineup of characters I agree some have to step down as just a cameo but to be the one that saves Tony and save the team from the ship firing down on them I’d say her role in the film is a little more than a cameo. 

Also Spider-Man may not have any flaws in endgame because I would say he is 100% a cameo and returning motivation for Tony as well as a fan pleasure. But in homecoming and I guess civil war his flaw is that he is yet to understand responsibility (insert uncle Ben joke here) but his innocence and cockiness is shown throughout the film.",1

"There is a wonderful backstory to this.  Takeda fell for Kung Jin and they ran off together to hide in Outland.  Jacqui lost it a bit and dove into work upgrading her tech significantly so she could hunt down the man who lead her love astray.  Using her newfound upgrade, she tracked them down and slaughtered Kung Jin in the middle of inseminating Takeda and crippled her would-be love.  Pointing her arm cannon to the skull of Takeda who held Kung Jin's perforated head in his lap, Jacqui handed him her mother's ring as she asked Takeda if there was anything he wanted to ask her.  Jacqui forged a new set of legs for her new fiance based off of her father's arms and kept a manual override in case her betrothed ever felt adventurous again.

"Has society really become so debased in recent times that we signal our respect to others by typing ""F""? How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - ""Call of Duty"", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and ""pressing F"". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice.

A blanket answer of “I’m going to tell everyone racism isn’t tolerated and fix the economy” and “I marched with MLK that one time”, just feels like outright pandering at best, and at worst a complete lack of awareness or understanding of the plight minority groups face. Warren at least was able to offer policy initiatives in the form of addressing the severe disparity in maternal care for black women.

I’m sure there will also be the same dumbfounded reactions from his supporters as it was in 2016 when he again fails to capture votes from minority demographics. His supporters should instead of dismissing the concerns of minorities as “causing division”, or condescending remarks such as “who are they going to vote for trump” (we aren’t even in primary territory yet ffs), put aside their personal feelings and try to listen to their fellow voters concerns, and use that to actively push the campaign to craft a message and policy that addresses them. 

That said, *I* will still vote for whomever wins the primary, but I at least understand the apathy of minority voters who just see more of the same empty hollow promises and platitudes, and simply sit it out because things won’t change regardless, and instead only get worse.",1

"So basically its too hard to fix the problem so lets not bother?

Banning guns and getting them off the street wont happen overnight anywhere, much less USA. But eventually getting rid of as many as possible will cause a big drop in these mass shootings I'd suspect.

We had the Port Arthur massacre in 1996. Following this, 640,000 guns were taken off the streets. Since then, we've had a mass shooting involving a single family in Perth (either this year or last IIRC), and the Lindt cafe seige in 2014, by a terrorist. We've had absolutely nothing on the scale of the sorts of attacks frequently happening in America. Its really not that complicated.

Sure, theres still illegal guns floating around the country, and they'll never get every single gun off the streets, but for the most part all we hear of here in Kangarooville are drug dealers being caught with the odd gun here and there. They're not out shooting up schools every day though so...",1

"This is purely hypothetical empty pro-sex work bag being lofted up by an anti-sex work sophist who wants some answers in what next.

No one here is going to say prostitution under a capitalist system is moral just like no one is arguing child labor under a capitalist system is moral (ethical utilitarian whatever) but if we can conceive the unicorn exists (I know people who like to do sex work and are self employed and choose their dates/films so yes exchanging your wellbeing for value in a capitalist system is immoral but the idea that some sex workers don’t enjoy their jobs is kind if puritan) then where does that unicorn fit into socialist society? Or are we saying she can’t possibly enjoy her work (we all know women hate sex). 

So yes it is exploitative to sell your body in a capitalist society no one has made the argument otherwise. The real question is what are you defining as sex therapy? How do you feel about brothel credits for the mentally deficient? Is that sex therapy or prostitution? Obviously it’s exploitation but where does the exploitation stop and the community ‘service’ begin.",1

"Not trying to argue or say you are wrong by any means (in fact, consensus opinion would seem to dictate that *I* am the one wrong), but this is why I don't understand. Here would be my breakdown of the same points.

Plot: Nothing special. Truly, it's a standard point A to point B plot, with a fresh coat of dusty, Australian paint. 

Soundtrack: Awesome, I agree.

Sound mixing: Eh, I mean I have no complaints and I guess that's all you can ask for. ""Incredible"" though implies it should stand out, which it never did to me.

Direction: With a plot this simple, I really cannot see many directors *not* ""delivering what it set out to do."" Not saying he did not do a good job, or that his own personal style did not heavily influence the film, but again I don't understand why so many people treat the direction here as godlike.

Cast: Hardy could have been any actor and it would have made no difference. I have no complaints over him, but Max as a character is hardly a difficult role. Charlize, great, I agree. Supporting cast, great, I agree.

Design: Great, I agree. Exceptional worldbuilding!

Editing: The movie made sense and flowed well. Again, with a plot this simple, I do not see this as a particularly marvelous accomplishment.

Again, these are just my opinions! I am not saying they're right or better than the general consensus. This is just my point of view on it. My biggest gripe is probably the plot, which the average person seemed to think was incredible, whereas I thought it was *at the absolute best,* serviceable. When measured up against other action movies, it does not stand out in the least. The strongest element was the worldbuilding to me, by a mile. Remarkable job on that aspect. :)",1

"I do not see this as valid criticism. I actually see this as criticism for the sake of criticism. Just because none of the 10 fan theories you read came to be true, doesn’t mean you start finding flaws where there aren’t any lol.

Why did the main characters survive? Think about it strong and hard, what possible explanation could there be for Brienne, Jon, Danny, tormund, jamie to survive? Well it’s because all of these guys are exceptional warriors and have been portrayed as such throughout the show (exception Danny but she has dragons lol). Throughout the show, each and every one of these individuals has been shown to be more courageous, more determined, more skilled than the others at combat. If any one survived, it should be these people.

Jorah mormont survives the first charge because he is a more accomplished warrior compared to the dothrakis - there is nothing that should be surprising here. Greyworm survived because he is the leader of the unsullied and why is that? Because he is the best of the unsullied.

Jon and Danny survived because they had dragons and weren’t part of the battle for the most part.

Bran survived because he had a full blown mini army protecting him, plus a certain Arya who is perhaps one of the most accomplished assassins ever to set foot in Westeros.

Why did Tyrion and Sansa survive, because they were the smartest of the people in the crypt and took shelter and hid when others did not think to do so.

I mean if you’re going to talk about plot armor, how the fuck did the night king not die of dragon fire when Danny smoked his ass? I see no one complaining about that.

Yes, the battle of winterfell wasn’t perfect but, for anything that hyped, how can it even be perfect? Out of tens of millions watching the show, there were always going to be subsets who were going to have issues with the story and the plot.

All the people complaining right now, it just makes no sense to me because if you want to talk about plot armor, each and every character has been in extremely dangerous situations before and guess what, they all made it to the last season.  I guess what you folks really wanted is for everyone to die in season 3 lol.",1

"&gt;A) correlation does not mean causation; there are many environmental factors that impact educational and intellectual capacities

And? the fact that there is a correlation already justifies the position. Every part of that statement is true. Low IQ parents are more likely to have low IQ children. 

&gt;B) none of these components that you guys claim are demonstrated to be based on genetics, they are environmentally-impacted

 People with low IQ's are more likely to get abortions - Doesn't do be a genetic factor that causes them to get abortions. Point is they are more likely to. 

IQ is strongly correlated with biological parents - This is based on genetics. See Heritability of Intelligence",1

"Feminism *is* about hating men tho, the fact that they are factually correct is not really relevant. Just like how white supremacist can say that black women lead the nation in obesity and STD rates. It may be factually true, but their *objective* is to spread race based hatred. The same is true here, men obviously are more aggressive and are more violent, but femanazis only use that truth in their efforts to spread hatred and fear. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Hate Facts"" as they are known are always a ""carriage in front of the horse"" type of deal. You have to look at what a persons agenda is when you are analyzing their argument. The media railing against men is indeed an attack on men, their hate-facts are just a weapon so it doesnt matter if theyre true. Femanazis agenda includes spreading gender based fear and hatred - so I say fuck them cows.",1

I'm sure most of my peers would prefer getting a 90%, but only focusing on 50% of the content, opposed to getting a 75 by learning 75% of the curriculum. Honestly if someone cares enough (and has a choice between multiple profs)... just go to their office and talk to them for 5 minutes, or attend a lecture in the current semester (ie if you're deciding for winter semester, find out their fall lectures and just sit in for an hour) I learn more about their teaching / lecturing style, and if one of them really sticks out, I make an effort to get into their classes.

"Are we talking straight GTA-clone Saint's Row 1 or Alien-Invasion-Matrix-Superhero-Madness Saint's Row 4?

&gt;Created by Deep Silver Volition, *Saints Row* spans four installments and has become one of the top-selling video game franchises of all time. It tells the story of the rise of the Third Street Saints as they battle rival gangs in an attempt to conquer the fictional cities of Stilwater and Steelport.

I'm gonna say this writer didn't do much research.

&gt; Fenix is separately developing a feature adaptation of the video game *Echo*, and has set Derek Kolstad (*John Wick* trilogy) to write it.

"I think the biggest issue is the wage structure of a club. Take us (Arsenal) for example. We gave Ozil 350k and week and Mkhitaryan ~+200k a week because we thought it would be cheaper to give them those wages then spend money on a transfer fee replacement (if Ozil left and if we'd gone for someone other than Mkhitaryan for Sanchez). But what that's done is created an issue in our wage structure. We then had Ramsey asking for 200-300k, which we couldn't afford to pay him. It can have a knock on impact like that.

Otherwise you'd just have the wages of already contracted players keep rising exponentially. Say Pogba's contract is about to expire or is up for renewal, do United go in with the mindset that it'd cost &gt;100million to replace Pobga so let's just give him an 80million payrise and save money? It'd be unsustainable.",0

A blanket answer of “I’m going to tell everyone racism isn’t tolerated and fix the economy” and “I marched with MLK that one time”, just feels like outright pandering at best, and at worst a complete lack of awareness or understanding of the plight minority groups face. Warren at least was able to offer policy initiatives in the form of addressing the severe disparity in maternal care for black women.

I’m sure there will also be the same dumbfounded reactions from his supporters as it was in 2016 when he again fails to capture votes from minority demographics. His supporters should instead of dismissing the concerns of minorities as “causing division”, or condescending remarks such as “who are they going to vote for trump” (we aren’t even in primary territory yet ffs), put aside their personal feelings and try to listen to their fellow voters concerns, and use that to actively push the campaign to craft a message and policy that addresses them. 

That said, *I* will still vote for whomever wins the primary, but I at least understand the apathy of minority voters who just see more of the same empty hollow promises and platitudes, and simply sit it out because things won’t change regardless, and instead only get worse.",1

"That's why I said it could have been more satisfying (from a viewer standpoint). But from a writing standpoint, it made complete sense why the NK would avoid ever having to face Jon in combat.


The NK is a glass canon necromancer, if he falls then all his people falls with him. He has seen Jon kill one of his commanders at Hardhome, which he had no reason to believe were even vulnerable until that moment. He has seen Jon fight again in 7x06 and knows he is a very powerful opponent, why would he ever let Jon get close enough to face him?

A moment where the NK let his guard down was the only real thing that made sense, and since we still need to take care of Cersei/the Iron Throne later in the season, it made sense that it happened in episode 3. George has said from the beginning that this wouldn't be a good vs evil story, but a story of human conflict.

I definitely think it could have been executed better, but it's also fitting for GoT to not give in to prophecies and 'connections' between characters just to complete their story. It can be satisfying for viewers but it's something both the show and the books have been trying to stay away from. The NK never really had any interest in Jon so they weren't really nemeses anyway.

I don't necessarily like that it was Arya who killed him, but it can definitely be argued that having Jon kill him would have been equally disappointing and a little cheap as well.",0

"Why is jon fighting the nightking his arc? People keep chucking this around because he’s had a stare off with him a few times, so you not think that’s because the night king realises jon has a sword that can kill him? The NK doesn’t want to 1v1 Jon And that’s foreshadowed multiple times by raising multiple dead to protect him whenever jon gets close to him even remotely. 

It seems to me you’re disappointed because you assumed his arc was to fight the NK when there’s no more evidence to support this than there is that his arc is to warn the rest of Westeros that he’s coming and only he can rally everyone in time to be ready for him and his army. That isn’t bad storytelling at all 

The 3ER arc is definitely linked with the NK specifically rather than jon anyway, and bran is technically responsible for killing him, by sending his very own catspaw assassin to do it, like the catspaw assassinh was sent for bran in season 1 same dagger ties together poetically. 

Peoples misconception of the arcs and mixing that with theories they’ve heard and prophecies they’ve taken either literally or misinterpreted is the problem here more than bad writing",1

I prefer the less is more approach compared to MK9 which was too over the top for my liking, especially as it made all the females appear the same aside from colour.

And I mean, Skarlet for example has holes in her alts for reason other than to expose her boobs, so it's not like NRS has completely desexualized the game. I think it's all quite overblown.

However it also depends on the character. If they covered Mileena like they did with Skarlet's default, I'd be mad lol. Mileena's sex appeal is a huge part of her character.",0

"DSFix is all you need if you just plan on playing solo.  The online component is pretty broken on its own, though, so if you ever plan to do coop or pvp, you'll need Wulf's Dark Souls Connectivity Mod.  It's actually something you run while running the game, and can keep you 'aware' or 'connected' to up to 32 different worlds (though the summoning/hosting/invading caps are the same).

https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1047/

If you DO plan to host or invade, or you want to make sure you don't get invaded by hackers while doing coop, you'll want PVP Watchdog.  You can still get invaded by hackers, but it gives you a quick disconnect button that kicks them out of your world (or ejects you from theirs) if it detects hacks or illegal stats in play.  It also gives you a nice little chirp to let you know you've been invaded by a player, in case you happen to be looking at something other than the game.

"I felt bad for you at first but then you literally shred her culture into pieces. 

Dowry in Chinese culture is not a law but tradition.  Husbands also often help out with wife's family.  You may not want to follow that, which is completely fine, but it sound like you don't actually know the Chinese family cultures and traditions. 

There is no fucking law against dowry in Canada. It is not illegal, just not recognized by law all the time in the specific cultural senses (which depends on the culture) but there has been court ruling to include a dowry.

In Chinese culture, dowry is made to the bride's family by the husband, not the other way round. And if a couple split, wife can still be rewarded a split of networth of the husband, or the other way round, for that matter.

I had property before I married but I recognize that once I get married, my husband can get a share of my networth/property. I love him and am happy to share ny life and everything in it with him.

I remember being so entranced with her singing to the point where I was almost trying to climb out the window to be near her, and I wasn't the one.

The truth is that this game has no new content so there is no reason to play it. A battle royale game getting nothing but a new character and a new gun in ~2 months is pretty bad. Not even a change to the map or any significant balance changes except for an overbuff to the Longbow.  

Battle royale games are repetitive. You’re playing running simulator for a good majority of the match FFS. It needs something to keep things entertaining.",1

"I found that even people who hate the film thought the throne room fight was redeeming - good choreography, fantastic cinematography, and good music. Laura Dern's whole character was a bit confusing, but I suspect she was there to tell us more about Poe - I think she obscured her plans because she knew Poe would try to stop her, implying that Poe is selfless, at least more so than we've been led to believe. Snoke was killed by his own hubris, and as interesting as he was, he was unimportant. And the light speed thing does make me skeptical - why haven't we seen that before? My best guess is the ships large enough to a) have a hyperdrive and b) inflict that level of damage need manual piloting, and so to do it is essentially suicide.

I genuinely do not remember Rey besting Luke, nor do I remember her demonstrating any Force abilities beyond what we've seen from Luke, Anakin, Yoda, or Palpatine. What scenes were you referring to?",1

"I don't really think there is a chance he would be ashamed of you(you wouldn't have gotten to 7 months...) Some people just don't like this kind of picturesc. They think it is kinda childish. I did it too a lot (during a 2 year relationship between 15-17) and it wasn't because I was ashamed of her. Everyone knew about us. Well I didn't like pictures at all. Now I started posting pictures with me(found out I kinda look good in pics and that made me change my mind). Even I broke up with her when this change happened some months ago, a pic with a gf would still be weird for me by that time. Now I got another gf. She posted pics of us or instagram stories decent times. This made me get used to the idea and now I want to post one with her too(I am pretty strict with pics so it gotta be smth really good haha). 

It isn't unusual for someone to not like this kind of pics. And it isn't necesary a sign of him being ashamed or cheating.I know a guy who cheated on his gf more than one time and he has a lot of pics with her and they are togheter for almost 2 years. It depends on more things.

Edit: As some1 else said maybe he doesn't want his relatives to find out. I can find myself in this too. I don't want them to know about anything I post so I blocked them a while ago haha. I did this because they are going to talk about this non stop if they find out I have a gf. And the way they do it makes me feel weird in the relationship and I don't want them to ruin it.

"There are over 7,500 universities and 5,500 fraternity chapters in America. Hazing is bound to happen at some of them, especially in south and to be honest, conservative states in general, but it's not the gold standard, and not all hazing is the 3rd degree shit that you read about online. IFC (official) frats are also far less likely to haze. It's the non-IFC frats that haze, and haze hard (even at my alma mater) - so avoid them like the plague.

Additionally, the definition of hazing is so damn murky. At my alma mater, hazing was loosely defined by the administration as making someone do something they don't want to do. Is an event where everyone has to play Edward 40 hands really hazing? How about memorizing the Greek alphabet and chapter/fraternity history (which is easy to remember), then getting quizzed and having to do push-ups if you get the answers wrong? How about scavenger hunts that involved fun, but questionable activities? How about cleaning the frat house after parties we also went to? The only event that I think was actual hazing was the night they brought strippers to the house. In addition to normal things like lap dances and making us lay down and hold lollipops in our mouth that would penetrate them as they rode our faces, they also shit talked, smacked, and straight up whipped some of us while everyone, including our fellow pledge brothers, laughed our asses off at the madness. It was a fucking blast.

Exemptions for things like disabilities were **always** made, and in retrospect, a lot these were just team building exercises, as unifying everyone against the dick pledgemaster was similar to how boot camp and drill sergeants, just a thousand times easier. The wild shit that my pledge brothers and I endured is why the bonds I have with them are stronger than the bonds I have with any other friends I've ever made. Some fraternities go a bit harder, but as long as it doesn't endanger your health or sanity, it'll be drowned out by all the fun nights and you'll oddly look bad at it fondly. Pledge is universally known as ""the best time you'll never want to have again,"" and it truly is that.


One thing I'd like to add for anyone who wants to or is currently pledging: if the fraternity you're pledging starts *really* hazing you, eg, putting your life in danger, physically harming you, and taking things like the yelling too far to the point that you can't handle it emotionally, then drop. That is, unless you plan on going into the military, in which case it's good practice, because the military hazes harder than pretty much any modern frat.",1

"No, it would be completely different. Coal is formed through a prolonged period of sedimentary-metamorphic processes. As a depositional environment, think swampy and plant rich area. That gets compressed and due to volumes of water migrating out of the material combined with that increasing pressure, the material undergoes both physical and chemical changes, all while heated cementation occurs. The taste? It would taste very much like pencil lead. Lava (a material derived from igneous origins), on the other hand, is usually characterized by the amount of molten silica content that is contained within the mixture. Those with high amounts of silica (and iron) are considered Felsic, and those with low amounts of silica (and magnesium) are considered Mafic. And, assuming that you could actually hold a cup of it in your hand and pour it into your mouth because of its viscosity (higher amounts of silica, think peanut butter. Lower amounts of silica, think syrup) and that it wouldn’t completely set your face on flames before your mouth even gets a chance to make physical contact with it, it would posses a very burnt-oven type metallic taste. So, lava does not have the taste of coal.",0

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

I have a spare room in my home.  I have it listed as ""room for rent, call for details. Xxx""

The terms the room is available under are as follows:  monthly rent will be $0.00.  The room is offered with a bathroom across the hall that myself and my child will not use. I do ask that it is kept decent so that guests can use it.  Plus access to use the garage to store their vehicle. The roommate will be requested to pay 1/3 of existing utilities.  And if he/she wants wifi or television services 100% of that.  In return for the free room I request that the roommate be home by 9:30 pm to 7am Sunday through Thursday as I work over night, and need someone in the home with my child.  I will put him to bed before I leave and I will wake him and make breakfast when I get home. With about a week of notice if they won't be home so I can find alternative care. 

I have a candidate who wants the room but is demanding I also pay her $200 in childcare.  

AITA for requesting that she do this for free?  If you think I am, what do you think is a fair fee for childcare? Should I charge rent on the room?

"I found that even people who hate the film thought the throne room fight was redeeming - good choreography, fantastic cinematography, and good music. Laura Dern's whole character was a bit confusing, but I suspect she was there to tell us more about Poe - I think she obscured her plans because she knew Poe would try to stop her, implying that Poe is selfless, at least more so than we've been led to believe. Snoke was killed by his own hubris, and as interesting as he was, he was unimportant. And the light speed thing does make me skeptical - why haven't we seen that before? My best guess is the ships large enough to a) have a hyperdrive and b) inflict that level of damage need manual piloting, and so to do it is essentially suicide.

"I found that even people who hate the film thought the throne room fight was redeeming - good choreography, fantastic cinematography, and good music. Laura Dern's whole character was a bit confusing, but I suspect she was there to tell us more about Poe - I think she obscured her plans because she knew Poe would try to stop her, implying that Poe is selfless, at least more so than we've been led to believe. Snoke was killed by his own hubris, and as interesting as he was, he was unimportant. And the light speed thing does make me skeptical - why haven't we seen that before? My best guess is the ships large enough to a) have a hyperdrive and b) inflict that level of damage need manual piloting, and so to do it is essentially suicide.

"I love how you just assume nothing works.  Have you considered you’re wrong?  Here’s what I know:  the only people that want nothing to change are the worst people.  They either have skin in the game or worship at the altar of conservatism and hate liberals.

You’re not even right.  An AR-15 has been used in almost every mass shooting.  Hey, maybe we ban them?  Some guns have been purchased on the spot.  Maybe ban that?  Domestic violence charge?  Barred from firearms purchases.  Make getting a gun like getting a driver’s license.  National standards would be nice.  Not being able to go to a neighboring state to purchase would be nice.  Here’s a fucking thing:  LET SMART PEOPLE STUDY GUN VIOLENCE.  Some cunt or cunts have prevented any and all research on gun violence.  That should be reversed and the people/organizations responsible for preventing that research should publicly executed.  I’m not serious, but I’m that angry.  Justifiably.  Only a cunt whose money is at stake would be against studies on gun violence, what it does, why it happens, and what can be done to decrease/prevent it.  Anyone that doesn’t have money in guns being sold but still thinks banning gun violence studies is good should get all of the worst diseases and suffer every day for the rest of their lives.

"It’s like we’re right back in 2016 with Bernie supporters telling POC’s that issues which specifically impact their communities don’t matter. A blanket answer of “I’m going to tell everyone racism isn’t tolerated and fix the economy” and “I marched with MLK that one time”, just feels like outright pandering at best, and at worst a complete lack of awareness or understanding of the plight minority groups face. Warren at least was able to offer policy initiatives in the form of addressing the severe disparity in maternal care for black women.

I’m sure there will also be the same dumbfounded reactions from his supporters as it was in 2016 when he again fails to capture votes from minority demographics. His supporters should instead of dismissing the concerns of minorities as “causing division”, or condescending remarks such as “who are they going to vote for trump” (we aren’t even in primary territory yet ffs), put aside their personal feelings and try to listen to their fellow voters concerns, and use that to actively push the campaign to craft a message and policy that addresses them. 

That said, *I* will still vote for whomever wins the primary, but I at least understand the apathy of minority voters who just see more of the same empty hollow promises and platitudes, and simply sit it out because things won’t change regardless, and instead only get worse.",1

She didn’t finish the training but she got the drop on Jaquen and bested the waif.

What’s the actual benefit in her knowing the details of this? “Your dad is a shithead who cheated, btw bye see you never!” Great, so the child loses a person who was in her life, and now potentially thinks terribly of and doesn’t trust her actual parent. That’s just perfect! Where do things go from here? Surely up, for those rosy teenage years when nothing ever goes wrong!

OP basically got to drop a bomb and walk out in the aftermath. I am in no way justifying what happened to her. It completely sucks that this person she loved cheated on her, and what the dad did is complete shit. However, it’s not like OP is going to be around to do anything for this kid in the future.

We've had absolutely nothing on the scale of the sorts of attacks frequently happening in America. Its really not that complicated.

And if it really bothered you that much, why not just buy her a nice dress or two that you liked as a present to her? It would’ve been a lot more thoughtful and heartfelt than throwing cash at her and basically telling her she looks like a trash fire.",1

"&gt;But before that Maduro could have also realized the very weak hold he has over his own state and not want to risk it on someone who he didn't see as a real threat.

Such a weak hold that we're months into an ongoing coup/scandal with opposition backed by every major Western power yet there's Maduro, still in charge. 

He's a power hungry dictator!

He's barely in control of his own country!

No I think far more likely is that Maduro knew Guaido never had enough support within the country to take power, and that any successful attempt from Guaido would require direct assistance from the US. From what I can tell, Venezuelans are much more opposed to American intervention than they are either leader in particular. If the US sends troops, Maduro's done either way. If they don't, Guaido keeps trying these desperate coup attempts internally, embarrassing himself each time they fail. 

Venezuela's in economic shambles thanks both to over-dependence on oil revenue and brutal US sanctions. But the picture John Bolton is trying to paint, of a brutal anti-democratic dictator desperately trying to quell political chaos on the ground to the point of necessitating foreign intervention just seems like pure propaganda to me. Is Maduro a ""good"" guy? No, probably not. But is Guaido the rightfully elected president, leading an attempted coup at the will of the people? Almost definitely not that, either.",0

&gt;...isn't being overly sexual a sign of being sexually abused? Like ya kids start exploring at that age but I feel sex toys pushes it a bit too far.

Not really. It needs to be considered within an environmental context. The child is likely learning about sex in school and is curious. This is a sensitive period, and not a good time to shame them (if there is one).

&gt;Also if a 6th grader told her teacher or someone she trusted that her parents were buying her sex toys, CPS would be getting involved.

There may be questions since it isn't the norm. A social worker would want to determine the circumstances of the matter, but there wouldn't be an apprehension for allowing a child to explore their sexual development in a healthy way.",1

"It’s like we’re right back in 2016 with Bernie supporters telling POC’s that issues which specifically impact their communities don’t matter. A blanket answer of “I’m going to tell everyone racism isn’t tolerated and fix the economy” and “I marched with MLK that one time”, just feels like outright pandering at best, and at worst a complete lack of awareness or understanding of the plight minority groups face. Warren at least was able to offer policy initiatives in the form of addressing the severe disparity in maternal care for black women.

I’m sure there will also be the same dumbfounded reactions from his supporters as it was in 2016 when he again fails to capture votes from minority demographics. His supporters should instead of dismissing the concerns of minorities as “causing division”, or condescending remarks such as “who are they going to vote for trump” (we aren’t even in primary territory yet ffs), put aside their personal feelings and try to listen to their fellow voters concerns, and use that to actively push the campaign to craft a message and policy that addresses them.

"This all makes sense in hindsight knowing the Night King won't engage the battlefield from the start and that the undead army will roll out as an unstoppable wave, overwhelming the entire army. Everybody can make a better battle plan knowing all the moves of the enemy.

Your points make a lot of sense, all points are correct, but all of them stem from knowing how the battle rolled out. What they knew of the enemy at the point was that they have a lot of infantry who usually just run forward without any sense of formation, and they have a dragon for massive air support (edit: the NK can throw spears that oneshot dragons). They didn't know where the dragon would be coming from, if they can stop the advance of the undead, if they can trust the walls at all etc. I see it impossible to funnel that initial wave of undead to any chokepoint, the softened up wave just climbed and rolled over the walls too.

What they knew was that they wanted the Night King to focus on Bran, to believe he was unprotected and intercept him as he was going for the kill.

&gt;No boiling oil, pitch, or other incendiaries thrown down onto the wights scaling the walls

This tough, do you want undead climbing the wall or undead on fire climbing the wall? They don't just disintegrate when they touch fire, it just stops them from getting back up after a 'killing' blow.

Sorry, it's not personal, I see all these posts about the battle tactics and they reek of a Total War save+reload to win which is a cheap victory.",0

She didn’t finish the training but she got the drop on Jaquen and bested the waif. They can’t show every little intricate detail of the training that she went through so they just showed the parts that looked good onscreen. She snuck up on Jon in broad daylight which I would say adds a little bit of difficulty. She also wasn’t attempting to assassinate him so I assume she was probably moving at a leisurely pace. The point of them showing causing that white walkers hair to move like that was to show that she was too quick to be noticed which is why they weren’t able to do anything. I think the dragon fire vs valerian steel question is dumb. And I agree that there were issues with the episode,1

Maduro is a shitty leader but as Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Iraq have proved of the last two decades a shitty leader is better than a failed state and a civil war. 

He should act now and jail all the opposition leaders, he has a perfect excuse for that – calling for an uprising and a military coup is not how democracy should work.
