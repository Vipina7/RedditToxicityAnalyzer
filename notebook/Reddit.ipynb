far left on a lot of things for me  and i like libertarianism but at some point it becomes anarchy  everyone is on the spectrum but the media we use kinda inherently puts us in bubbles because of these algorithms that try to feed us more of what we like    i ve longed for the old days of google where everybody got the same search results     everybody watched the same guy on the news every night   now everybody s become super polarized because we ve each developed our own echo chambers  that seems to be a result of our first past the pole system   and a ranking election system i feel would work a lot better but i digress     i consider myself in the middle leaning towards the left  i like bernie and his ideas but also we have to pay for it somehow      and i want you to smoke weed and marry your lesbian girlfriend on your own property while firing your rifles   but i also want those rifles registered and for background checks to be performed    every citizen to have basic science and arts education    regular mental health check ins and the ability for the police to revoke your weapons with a judge s consent    so like i love freedom but like also people be crazy so we need laws and enforcement   maybe people we elect to argue these laws and have studied them for years in college   who can state their beliefs and reach the great compromise    why does this sound familiar   sure the whole 2 3rds person thing was a problem   but we re not our parents or grandparents and this is part of the great experiment   australians have more guns per capita now than they did before their  assault weapons ban  followed by massive regulation and people turning in their unregistered or illegal weapons for government compensation  basically you could take your illegal rifle to a government point and you could sell it to them for the market value of the weapon  i honestly think that s a pretty good way to go about it and a model that we could follow     they have more guns in more people s hands but no mass shootings    so we could remove that embarrassment from america s facade and image    i feel like it s become a running joke that we have shootings in our schools daily and nobody cares   parkland kids started killing themselves because i think they see what i see and how polarized and awful the environment has become for everybody   my point is they have a successful gun control program without affecting legal owners and it works  common sense gun control is effective  and the nra is awful  not to mention i own a weapons  myself    more than a few rifles  two pistols and a shotgun  i love the second amendment but i feel like it s being abused   it was designed for times with muskets and technology has gone so far that       let me put it this way    if you need an assault rifle to take down a deer  you either really like lead and steel and copper in your food  or just really suck at shooting     i have a 22 target pistol that i really like because of the low kick back and i can put a lot of hurt in a little space in a short amount of time   same with the 9mm     my point is i want to talk to the government once a year and if i get in trouble with the law    i want my weapons taken away    because there are people out there much crazier than me and i would want the same rules applied   obviously the inner semantics of figuring out the rights of people would be hard but it s something we have to face and we have to recognize the influence of outside organizations like the nra   i guess what i m trying to say is i m sorry    i wasn t trying to offend you    and we need to work together to try to find a solution       or at least convince the people we elect  of the idea of having the great argument with each other rather than just painting smears and caricatures of each other    lt  3  i am a scientist displaced by the removal of scientific research into climate change    i m sure you re aware of the   administrative changes at that level around two years ago   i want to move to another country because i m embarrassed   and i m scared for the future of science and engineering in this part of the world   but i want to stay because i recently acquired a dream job and generally in the past that s put me in a position to hire people from other countries to really make america great again   you might have heard of them   it s a little start up that likes to land its rockets    not really a big deal   i m italian german  but american first  we are a country of immigrants  except for the obvious indigenous exceptions    sorry people who aren t white  we need to celebrate each other s heritage and each other s prosperity also bettering the land of freedom our ancestors or ourselves travel to   the owner of fox news is famously an immigrant and went before congress to testify in favor of laxing immigration policies     when did our melting pot become queso blanco   i want some flavor and some funk in that cheese   give me what only america can and give us   the best of the world not just the best of our rich  ethnically blessed few    the southern switch and the rise of fundamentalism and religion in conservative politics has poisoned conservative and libertarian ideas to a point where it is unrecognizable and lincoln would be ashamed of the party that republicanism has become      sorry for
